<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Institute for Energy Research (IER) is a nonprofit organization established in 1989 that conducts research and analysis on global energy markets. Based in Washington, D.C., IER advocates for free-market energy policies, emphasizing that minimally regulated energy markets provide the most efficient solutions to global energy and environmental challenges. The organization has been influential in shaping energy policy debates, particularly in its opposition to regulatory measures aimed at addressing climate change (<a href="https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org">IER</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Energy_Research">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>IER’s mission is to inform policymakers, the media, and the public about energy and environmental issues through research and analysis that support free-market principles. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Policy Advocacy:</strong> IER promotes policies favoring deregulation and the expansion of fossil fuels. It frequently opposes government interventions such as emissions trading and renewable energy mandates (<a href="https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org">IER</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Research and Publications:</strong> The organization produces reports and analyses on energy policy, market trends, and environmental regulations. These publications often argue against the scientific consensus on climate change and criticize efforts to reduce carbon emissions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Energy_Research">Wikipedia</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Public Engagement:</strong> IER engages with the public and policymakers through events, briefings, and digital content, aiming to influence energy policy discussions (<a href="https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org">IER</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Robert L. Bradley Jr.:</strong> Founder and CEO of IER, Bradley is a prominent advocate of free-market energy policies. He has authored several books on energy policy and is a senior fellow at multiple conservative think tanks (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Energy_Research">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Thomas J. Pyle:</strong> President of IER and its political arm, the American Energy Alliance (AEA). Pyle played a key role in the Trump administration as a member of the Department of Energy transition team, where he promoted a fossil fuel-friendly agenda (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Energy_Research">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.energyandpolicy.org">Energy &amp; Policy Institute</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Daniel Kish:</strong> Senior Vice President of Policy, Kish has extensive experience in energy policy and is a vocal critic of environmental regulations that he views as detrimental to the energy sector (<a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>IER has strong connections to the Trump administration, particularly through Thomas Pyle’s involvement in the Department of Energy’s transition team. IER’s policy recommendations, which often favor the fossil fuel industry, align closely with Trump’s energy policies, including the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and the rollback of environmental regulations (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Energy_Research">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.energyandpolicy.org">Energy &amp; Policy Institute</a>).</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Climate Change Denial:</strong> IER is widely recognized as a leading organization that questions the scientific consensus on climate change. Critics argue that its stance undermines global efforts to combat climate change and reflects the interests of its fossil fuel industry donors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Energy_Research">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.energyandpolicy.org">Energy &amp; Policy Institute</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Fossil Fuel Industry Ties:</strong> IER has received significant funding from fossil fuel entities such as ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute. This financial support has led to accusations that IER’s research is biased in favor of the fossil fuel industry (<a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com">HuffPost</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Institute for Energy Research plays a significant role in shaping energy policy from a free-market perspective. Its strong ties to the Trump administration and fossil fuel industry, along with its controversial stance on climate change, underscore the need for careful scrutiny of its research and policy recommendations (<a href="https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org">IER</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
