<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Alabama Policy Institute (API) is a nonprofit conservative think tank based in Birmingham, Alabama. Founded in 1989 as the Alabama Family Alliance, the organization was renamed in 2000. API is dedicated to shaping public policy in Alabama through research, advocacy, and educational initiatives focused on free markets, limited government, and strong families. API has become a significant force in state politics, influencing debates on education, taxation, healthcare, and other key issues (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Policy_Institute">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.alreporter.com">Alabama Political Reporter</a>).</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>API’s mission is to advance conservative values by influencing policy at the state level. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Policy Research:</strong> API conducts studies on various topics, including education, economics, and government reform. Their reports often shape the legislative agenda in Alabama.</li>
  <li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> The institute engages with lawmakers to promote conservative policies, such as opposing Medicaid expansion and supporting school choice (<a href="https://www.alabamapolicy.org">Alabama Policy Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.alreporter.com">Alabama Political Reporter</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Public Education:</strong> API offers educational programs, podcasts, and events to inform the public about conservative solutions to policy issues (<a href="https://altoday.com">Alabama Today</a>, <a href="https://www.alabamapolicy.org">API 2024 Blueprint</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stephanie Smith:</strong> President and CEO since January 2023, Smith has a background in governmental affairs and finance, with experience in both the private and public sectors. She has been vocal about her conservative stance, particularly criticizing the Alabama GOP for not being conservative enough on issues such as education and taxation (<a href="https://www.alreporter.com">Alabama Political Reporter</a>, <a href="https://altoday.com">Alabama Today</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>J. Pepper Bryars:</strong> Senior Fellow with extensive experience in law, ministry, and military service. Bryars is known for his work in public policy and advocacy, contributing to the conservative discourse in Alabama.</li>
  <li><strong>Scott Stantis:</strong> Distinguished Fellow and editorial cartoonist, Stantis contributes to API’s cultural and political commentary, bringing a unique perspective to the organization’s outreach efforts (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Policy_Institute">Wikipedia</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>API’s policy positions align closely with broader conservative agendas often associated with the Trump administration. Although API does not have direct ties to Trump, its advocacy on issues such as school choice, tax policy, and opposition to Medicaid expansion resonate with Trump’s political base and the broader conservative movement (<a href="https://www.alreporter.com">Alabama Political Reporter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Policy_Institute">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Bias:</strong> As a conservative think tank, API’s research and policy recommendations are influenced by its ideological stance. This may affect the objectivity of its analysis and proposals (<a href="https://www.alabamapolicy.org">Alabama Policy Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Controversial Policy Positions:</strong> API’s stance on issues like labor laws, educational freedom, and healthcare has sparked debate. For example, the 2024 Blueprint includes controversial suggestions such as opposing Medicaid expansion and advocating for voter ID laws (<a href="https://www.alabamapolicy.org">API 2024 Blueprint</a>, <a href="https://www.alreporter.com">Alabama Political Reporter</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Alabama Policy Institute plays a pivotal role in shaping conservative public policy in Alabama. While its research and advocacy efforts significantly influence legislative decisions, the strong ideological leanings and connections to conservative movements necessitate careful consideration of its recommendations. The organization’s impact on state politics highlights both its power and the potential for polarizing public debate (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Policy_Institute">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.alreporter.com">Alabama Political Reporter</a>).</p>
