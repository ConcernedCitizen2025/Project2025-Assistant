<ul>
  <li><strong>Larry P. Arnn:</strong> President of Hillsdale College since 2000, Arnn has been a strong advocate for classical education and conservative principles. He was a member of President Trump’s 1776 Commission, which aimed to promote patriotic education (<a href="https://www.hillsdale.edu">Hillsdale College</a>).</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>Hillsdale College has maintained strong connections with the Trump administration. Key leaders, such as Larry Arnn and Matthew Spalding, were directly involved in the 1776 Commission, which aimed to counter progressive narratives in education. These connections illustrate Hillsdale’s influence in shaping conservative educational policies (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsdale_College">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Bias in Education:</strong> The college’s strong emphasis on conservative and patriotic education, especially through initiatives like the 1776 Commission, may raise concerns about the objectivity and inclusivity of its educational programs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsdale_College">Wikipedia</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hillsdale College plays a significant role in promoting conservative values through its classical liberal arts education and involvement in national educational initiatives like the 1776 Commission. Its connections to the Trump administration highlight its influence in shaping conservative educational policies. However, its strong ideological stance raises questions about the inclusivity and diversity of perspectives within its educational framework (<a href="https://www.hillsdale.edu">Hillsdale College</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsdale_College">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
