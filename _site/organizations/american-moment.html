<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Bias:</strong> American Moment’s research and policy recommendations are influenced by its ideological stance, which may affect the objectivity of its analysis and proposals.

  <li><strong>Controversial Policy Positions:</strong> The organization’s stance on issues like labor laws, educational freedom, and healthcare has sparked debate.
