        <h1 id="independent-womens-forum-iwf">Independent Women’s Forum (IWF)</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Independent Women’s Forum (IWF) is a conservative non-profit organization founded in 1992. It was established as a response to the Supreme Court nomination of Clarence Thomas and has since positioned itself as a counter to mainstream feminist organizations. IWF advocates for policies that emphasize economic liberty, personal responsibility, and limited government intervention. The organization has grown significantly, becoming a prominent voice in conservative circles, particularly on issues related to women’s rights, healthcare, and education (<a href="https://www.iwf.org">IWF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Women%27s_Forum">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>IWF’s mission is to improve the lives of Americans by increasing the number of women who value free markets and personal liberty. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Policy Advocacy:</strong> IWF actively promotes conservative positions on issues such as healthcare, education, and economic policy. The organization is known for its opposition to mainstream feminist positions, advocating instead for what it calls “equity feminism,” which focuses on equal opportunity rather than equal outcomes (<a href="https://www.iwf.org">IWF</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Educational Outreach:</strong> IWF conducts research, publishes articles, and hosts events to educate the public and policymakers on conservative perspectives on key issues. The organization has been involved in campaigns against regulations it deems excessive, such as those on vaping and gun control (<a href="https://www.iwf.org">IWF</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Advocacy:</strong> Through its affiliate, the Independent Women’s Law Center, IWF engages in legal advocacy to protect free speech and challenge policies it views as discriminatory against women or restrictive of individual liberty (<a href="https://www.iwf.org">IWF</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Carrie Lukas:</strong> As President of IWF, Lukas has been a leading advocate for the organization’s policy positions. She frequently appears in the media to discuss issues such as healthcare, education, and economic policy from a conservative viewpoint (<a href="https://www.iwf.org">IWF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Heather R. Higgins:</strong> Chairman of the Board, Higgins plays a pivotal role in shaping IWF’s strategic direction. She also leads the Independent Women’s Voice (IWV), which is more politically active and focuses on electoral advocacy (<a href="https://www.iwf.org">IWF</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Nan Hayworth:</strong> A former U.S. Representative, Hayworth serves on the board and contributes to IWF’s healthcare and policy initiatives, drawing on her extensive experience in the field (<a href="https://www.iwf.org">IWF</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Larry Kudlow:</strong> A notable economic commentator and former Director of the National Economic Council under President Trump, Kudlow’s involvement with IWF underscores the organization’s deep ties to conservative economic policy (<a href="https://www.iwf.org">IWF</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>IWF has maintained strong connections with the Trump administration, particularly through figures like Larry Kudlow and other conservative leaders who have been associated with the organization. IWF’s policy advocacy, especially in areas such as healthcare and education, aligns closely with Trump’s agenda, emphasizing deregulation, free-market principles, and state-level governance over federal oversight (<a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Bias:</strong> IWF has faced criticism for promoting a conservative agenda under the guise of non-partisan advocacy. Critics argue that the organization’s positions, particularly on issues like reproductive rights and gender equality, do not fully represent the diversity of women’s views and may marginalize more progressive perspectives (<a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>, <a href="https://www.thenation.com">The Nation</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Influence of Corporate Funding:</strong> IWF has been criticized for receiving funding from corporate interests, including tobacco and fossil fuel industries, which may influence its advocacy against regulations in these areas (<a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>, <a href="https://www.exposedbycmd.org">CMD</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Independent Women’s Forum plays a significant role in conservative advocacy, focusing on policies that enhance economic liberty and personal responsibility. While its leadership and connections to the Trump administration highlight its influence, the organization’s strong ideological stance and potential lack of inclusivity raise concerns that warrant careful consideration (<a href="https://www.iwf.org">IWF</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>).</p>
