<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) is a conservative think tank founded in 1982 and based in Washington, D.C. It advocates for policies rooted in free-market principles, individual liberty, and personal responsibility. NCPPR engages in policy research and public advocacy on a wide range of issues, including national defense, economic policy, environmental regulation, and corporate governance (<a href="https://www.nationalcenter.org">NCPPR</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>NCPPR’s mission is to promote innovative and free-market solutions to public policy problems. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Policy Analysis:</strong> NCPPR produces detailed policy analysis and advocates for free-market approaches in areas such as environmental policy, healthcare, and economic regulation. The organization has been particularly active in opposing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives in corporate America (<a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>, <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu">Harvard Law</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Project 21:</strong> This initiative is a network of African-American conservative leaders that provides a platform to discuss public policy issues from a conservative perspective. Project 21 has released publications like the <em>Blueprint for a Better Deal for Black America</em>, which offers free-market solutions to improve economic opportunities in African-American communities (<a href="https://www.nationalcenter.org">NCPPR</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Public_Policy_Research">Wikipedia</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Free Enterprise Project:</strong> NCPPR also operates the Free Enterprise Project, which focuses on shareholder activism to counter corporate practices that it views as politically biased against conservative principles (<a href="https://www.nationalcenter.org">NCPPR</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>David A. Ridenour:</strong> President of NCPPR, Ridenour has been with the organization since its early days, previously serving as vice president. He has extensive experience in public policy and has testified before the United Nations and U.S. Congress (<a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>David Almasi:</strong> Vice President, Almasi has been with NCPPR since 1987 and oversees media relations and strategic initiatives (<a href="https://www.nationalcenter.org">NCPPR</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Horace Cooper:</strong> Co-chair of Project 21 and a senior fellow at NCPPR, Cooper is a former senior counsel to the U.S. House Majority Leader and an influential voice in conservative policy circles (<a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>NCPPR has connections to the Trump administration, particularly through its advocacy for deregulation and free-market policies that align with Trump’s economic agenda. The organization’s leadership, including figures like Horace Cooper, have been involved in conservative policy circles that influence the broader agenda supported by Trump and his affiliates (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Public_Policy_Research">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Bias:</strong> NCPPR’s strong conservative orientation may affect the objectivity of its research and advocacy. The organization has been involved in controversial positions, such as opposing climate change regulations and advocating for corporate interests over environmental concerns (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Public_Policy_Research">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Controversies:</strong> NCPPR faced significant controversy involving former board member Jack Abramoff, who was implicated in a lobbying scandal. This incident raised questions about the organization’s governance and ethical standards (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Public_Policy_Research">Wikipedia</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The National Center for Public Policy Research is a key player in the conservative policy landscape, promoting free-market solutions and individual liberty. Its significant influence in public policy debates and connections to the Trump administration highlight its role in shaping conservative policies. However, its political bias and past controversies necessitate careful scrutiny of its research and advocacy efforts (<a href="https://www.nationalcenter.org">NCPPR</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Public_Policy_Research">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
