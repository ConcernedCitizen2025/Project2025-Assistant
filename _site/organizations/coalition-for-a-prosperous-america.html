<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA) is a national bipartisan organization founded in 2007. It represents domestic producers across various sectors, including manufacturing, agriculture, and labor. CPA’s mission is to advocate for strategic trade, tax, and growth policies that prioritize American production and employment over cheap consumption. The organization has become a leading voice in promoting economic nationalism, particularly through its advocacy for protectionist trade policies and tariffs aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing and reducing trade deficits (<a href="https://prosperousamerica.org">CPA</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>CPA focuses on implementing policies that support American economic growth by enhancing domestic production capabilities. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Trade and Tariff Policy:</strong> CPA advocates for policies that protect American industries from unfair foreign competition and promote balanced trade. The organization supports high tariffs on imports, particularly from China, as a means to protect and rebuild U.S. industrial capacity (<a href="https://prosperousamerica.org">CPA</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Economic Research:</strong> The CPA Economics Team conducts independent research on issues related to trade, currency, and manufacturing. This research is used to inform policy decisions and public debate, and has been recognized for its impact on trade policy discussions (<a href="https://prosperousamerica.org">CPA</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Advocacy and Lobbying:</strong> CPA engages with policymakers to promote legislative changes that support domestic producers. This includes working closely with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers to advance its protectionist agenda (<a href="https://prosperousamerica.org">CPA</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Michael Stumo:</strong> CEO of CPA since its founding, Stumo oversees the organization’s strategic activities, including government affairs, public communications, and economic research. His leadership reflects CPA’s strong stance on protecting American industries through protectionist measures, often leading to tensions with global trade partners (<a href="https://prosperousamerica.org">CPA</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Jeff Ferry:</strong> Chief Economist at CPA, Ferry leads the organization’s economic research efforts. His work focuses on rebuilding American industrial strength and addressing trade imbalances, often advocating for protectionist trade measures that can be controversial in broader economic debates (<a href="https://prosperousamerica.org">CPA</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>CPA’s policy positions and advocacy have found strong support within the Trump administration, particularly regarding trade and economic nationalism. The organization played a significant role in influencing Trump’s tariff policies and continues to advocate for an America-first agenda in trade and economic policy (<a href="https://prosperousamerica.org">CPA</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Protectionist Policies:</strong> CPA’s advocacy for high tariffs and stringent trade policies may lead to trade wars and increased costs for consumers and businesses relying on imported goods. While these measures can support domestic industries, they risk retaliatory actions from trade partners and potential negative impacts on the global economy (<a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The organization’s focus on protectionism is central to its mission of supporting American industries, but this approach may contribute to broader economic tensions and challenges in international trade relations (<a href="https://prosperousamerica.org">CPA</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Coalition for a Prosperous America is a key player in advocating for policies that support American manufacturing and agricultural sectors. While its efforts to promote domestic production align with economic nationalism, the potential consequences of its protectionist policies warrant careful consideration. As CPA continues to influence U.S. trade and economic policies, its role in shaping the national agenda remains significant (<a href="https://prosperousamerica.org">CPA</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</p>
