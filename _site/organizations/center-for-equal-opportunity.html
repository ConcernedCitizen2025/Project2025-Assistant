<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Center for Equal Opportunity (CEO) is a conservative think tank founded in 1995 by Linda Chavez. The organization is dedicated to promoting a colorblind approach to public policy and advocating against affirmative action and other race-based preferences. CEO’s mission centers on the belief that all individuals should be treated equally under the law, without regard to race, ethnicity, or gender. The organization conducts research, engages in legal advocacy, and participates in public outreach to support its goals (<a href="https://www.ceousa.org">Center for Equal Opportunity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Equal_Opportunity">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>CEO focuses on conducting research and disseminating ideas that advocate for a nondiscriminatory and colorblind approach to public policy. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Research and Studies:</strong> CEO conducts studies on racial and ethnic preferences in college admissions and other areas, documenting the extent to which race factors into admissions decisions at numerous colleges and universities. This research often highlights the organization’s opposition to affirmative action (<a href="https://www.ceousa.org">Center for Equal Opportunity</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Advocacy:</strong> The organization files legal briefs in federal and state courts to challenge the use of race, sex, and national origin in education, employment, and contracting. CEO’s legal efforts are aimed at upholding what they consider to be true equality under the law (<a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Public Outreach:</strong> CEO influences public opinion through writing, speaking engagements, and media appearances. The organization also monitors government actions to ensure adherence to nondiscriminatory policies (<a href="https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org">Philanthropy Roundtable</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Linda Chavez:</strong> Founder and Chairman of CEO, Chavez has had a long and distinguished career in conservative politics, including serving as White House Director of Public Liaison under President Reagan. She is a prominent critic of affirmative action and has been a leading voice in advocating for colorblind public policies (<a href="https://www.marketscreener.com">MarketScreener</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Devon Westhill:</strong> President and General Counsel, Westhill has been a vocal advocate against race-based admissions policies. He previously served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the Trump administration, where he led civil rights programs (<a href="https://www.scotusblog.com">SCOTUSblog</a>).</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>CEO is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative aimed at shaping conservative policies for a future Republican administration. This involvement underscores CEO’s influence in conservative circles and its potential impact on future policy directions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Equal_Opportunity">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Opposition to Affirmative Action:</strong> CEO’s consistent opposition to affirmative action policies raises concerns about its impact on efforts to address historical and systemic racial inequalities. This stance contributes to ongoing debates about the best ways to achieve racial equity and whether colorblind policies can effectively address deep-rooted disparities (<a href="https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org">Philanthropy Roundtable</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Center for Equal Opportunity is a pivotal player in the conservative movement’s efforts to promote colorblind equal opportunity. While its mission and activities align with conservative values, the organization’s positions, particularly its opposition to affirmative action, provoke significant debate. As CEO continues to influence policy through its research, advocacy, and involvement with initiatives like Project 2025, its impact on the national discourse around race and equality will be critical to monitor (<a href="https://www.ceousa.org">Center for Equal Opportunity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Equal_Opportunity">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
