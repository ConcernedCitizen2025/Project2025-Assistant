<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Executive Vice President and General Counsel of America First Legal Foundation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Gene Hamilton serves as Executive Vice President and General Counsel of America First Legal Foundation. He previously held significant positions in the Trump administration, including Counselor to the Attorney General at the Department of Justice and Senior Counselor to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Hamilton has a law degree from Washington and Lee University School of Law and a BA in International Affairs from the University of Georgia. During his tenure in government, he was instrumental in shaping key immigration policies, including the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the “zero tolerance” policy leading to family separations at the border.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Hamilton served as Counsel to the Attorney General at the Department of Justice (DOJ) from 2017 to 2021. He worked closely with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other senior officials, playing a significant role in drafting and implementing immigration policies aligned with Trump’s agenda. Hamilton is now a prominent contributor to Project 2025, focusing on policy recommendations for immigration and DOJ reforms.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Hamilton’s professional work has been highly controversial, particularly his involvement in the Trump administration’s immigration policies. He was a key architect of the zero tolerance policy and played a major role in ending DACA, which has drawn significant criticism. His work with America First Legal, known for litigation aimed at preserving Trump-era policies, also continues to draw scrutiny. Additionally, the Department of Justice sought to disqualify him from a Texas immigration lawsuit due to potential conflicts of interest.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Hamilton’s advocacy for strict immigration policies and his involvement in controversial Trump administration policies may attract scrutiny. His work with Project 2025, which aims to overhaul federal immigration policies, may lead to more stringent enforcement measures and raise concerns about humanitarian and legal implications.</p>
