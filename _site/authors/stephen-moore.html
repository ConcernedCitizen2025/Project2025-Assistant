<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Economist and Senior Fellow at the Heritage Foundation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Stephen Moore is an American economist and policy analyst who currently serves as a Senior Fellow at the Heritage Foundation. He is also a co-founder of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity and a former member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board. Moore has held several prominent roles, including serving as a senior economic advisor to President Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. He holds a BA from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an MA from George Mason University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Stephen Moore served as a senior economic advisor during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, directly influencing the administration’s economic policies. His advocacy for tax cuts and deregulation aligned with Trump’s economic agenda. Although Trump nominated Moore for a position on the Federal Reserve Board in 2019, he withdrew his nomination amid criticism.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Federal Reserve Nomination:</strong> Moore’s nomination to the Federal Reserve Board was met with significant scrutiny over past statements and writings, including controversial comments about women and his economic policy positions. These issues led to bipartisan opposition and eventually caused Moore to withdraw from consideration.</li>
  <li><strong>Controversial Economic Views:</strong> Moore’s advocacy for supply-side economics and his economic forecasts have often been disputed by other economists. His positions, particularly on tax cuts and deregulation, have been criticized for potentially increasing income inequality.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Statements:</strong> Moore has been criticized for a series of public statements, including those perceived as sexist or dismissive of economic disparities. These controversies have further impacted his public reputation and credibility as an economic advisor.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Moore’s economic views, particularly his strong advocacy for tax cuts and deregulation, have drawn both support and criticism. His positions often align with supply-side economics, which some critics argue disproportionately benefit the wealthy and increase income inequality. Moore’s economic forecasts and statements have occasionally been disputed by other economists, raising concerns about the accuracy and impact of his policy recommendations.</p>
