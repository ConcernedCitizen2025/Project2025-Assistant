<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Chairman of the Board of CNP Action Inc., a sister organization of the Council for National Policy</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
William L. Walton is the Chairman of the Board of CNP Action Inc., the political advocacy arm of the Council for National Policy (CNP), a conservative think tank and networking organization. Walton is also known for his work as a private equity investor and his involvement in various conservative advocacy groups. He has a background in business and finance, having led investment firms and served on multiple corporate boards. Walton holds a BA from Indiana University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Although William L. Walton was not a member of the Trump administration, he played a significant role in Trump’s 2016 transition team as co-head of economic issues for federal agencies. Walton’s organization, the Council for National Policy (CNP), has been closely aligned with Trump’s agenda, supporting many of his policies and mobilizing conservative support for his initiatives. As the leader of CNP Action Inc., Walton is connected to a broader network of conservative activists and donors who have backed Trump’s presidency and continue to influence conservative policymaking.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
While William L. Walton has not been directly involved in major scandals, the Council for National Policy has faced criticism for its lack of transparency and the secretive nature of its meetings. The organization’s influence on conservative politics and its role in shaping policy discussions behind closed doors have been points of contention among advocates for greater transparency in political processes.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Walton’s leadership in CNP Action Inc. and his involvement in conservative advocacy have raised concerns about the influence of secretive networks on American politics. The Council for National Policy is known for its closed-door meetings and significant influence on conservative policies and political strategies. Critics argue that such organizations can undermine transparency and democratic processes by enabling wealthy individuals and interest groups to exert disproportionate influence.</p>
