<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Energy and Regulatory Attorney, Former Member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Street Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at the Appalachian School of Law</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Bernard L. McNamee is an experienced energy and regulatory attorney, currently serving as a partner at McGuireWoods LLP and a senior advisor at McGuireWoods Consulting. He is also the Street Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at the Appalachian School of Law. McNamee has a distinguished career in public service, having been appointed by President Donald Trump as a Commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), where he served from 2018 to 2020. His prior roles include senior policy and legal positions at the U.S. Department of Energy, legal advisor to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, and various roles in the administrations of Virginia Governor George Allen and Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Bernard McNamee, a Trump appointee to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), advocated in the Project 2025 blueprint for the next administration to repeal Biden’s climate and infrastructure laws and to enhance domestic energy production. McNamee criticized the Department of Energy for subsidizing renewable energy projects, arguing that it undermines energy security and distorts markets—a stance aligned with Trump’s deregulatory and fossil fuel-focused energy policies. His recommendations include eliminating political and climate-change interference in energy approvals and rescinding funds from major spending bills like Biden’s infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act. McNamee’s positions reflect his strong alignment with Trump’s energy agenda, having served in the Energy Department during Trump’s presidency and contributing to the conservative policy framework of Project 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
McNamee has been involved in controversies related to his views on energy policy, particularly his strong support for fossil fuels and skepticism of renewable energy mandates. His nomination to FERC was contentious, receiving criticism from environmental groups and some lawmakers who questioned his commitment to impartial regulation of the energy sector. However, McNamee has maintained that his decisions were based on legal and regulatory frameworks rather than ideological preferences .</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
As a key figure in Project 2025, McNamee is expected to influence future federal energy policies, potentially prioritizing deregulation and the continuation of policies that favor traditional energy sources over renewable alternatives. Critics argue that his approach may hinder the transition to cleaner energy and exacerbate environmental concerns, while supporters believe his focus on regulatory reform is necessary for economic stability and energy independence .</p>
