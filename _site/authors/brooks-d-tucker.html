<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Assistant Secretary for the Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Brooks D. Tucker served as the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from 2017 to 2021. He also held the role of Chief of Staff at the VA. Tucker has a distinguished background, including serving 20 years in the United States Marine Corps and working as a senior policy advisor to Senator Richard Burr. He holds a BA from The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Brooks D. Tucker served as Chief of Staff for the Department of Veterans Affairs from April 2020 to January 2021, after previously holding the position of Assistant Secretary within the same department. His roles were closely aligned with the Trump administration’s efforts to reform veterans’ healthcare and services. Tucker’s work in legislative affairs and policy implementation reflected the administration’s priorities. His involvement in Project 2025, particularly in shaping future policies for the VA under a potential second Trump term, further underscores his connection to Trump’s policy agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Tucker has not been involved in any major scandals or controversies personally. However, his tenure at the VA included oversight of significant and sometimes contentious policy changes, such as the VA MISSION Act. This act faced scrutiny over its effectiveness and concerns about potential impacts on veterans’ care, particularly regarding increased privatization efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Tucker’s leadership at the VA coincided with significant challenges, including the implementation of the VA MISSION Act, which aimed to improve veterans’ access to healthcare. While the act intended to increase efficiency and access, its rollout faced criticism regarding implementation issues and the potential privatization of VA services. Tucker’s role in Project 2025 also raises concerns, as the initiative emphasizes privatization and conservative reforms that some fear could undermine the VA’s ability to effectively serve veterans.</p>
