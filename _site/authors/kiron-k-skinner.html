<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Kiron K. Skinner served as the Director of Policy Planning at the State Department from 2018 to 2019. Her appointment was a key part of the Trump administration’s strategy to reshape U.S. foreign policy. In this role, she provided strategic guidance on initiatives aligned with the administration’s priorities, including a more assertive stance on China and a reevaluation of international alliances. Skinner’s work was instrumental in advancing the administration’s foreign policy agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Skinner’s time at the State Department was marred by internal controversies, including reports of management issues and clashes with colleagues. These conflicts ultimately led to her departure from the role. Additionally, her statements on U.S.-China relations and comments suggesting that the Cold War analogy could apply to U.S.-China relations were controversial and sparked debate among foreign policy experts.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
