<p><strong>Role:</strong> Director of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project, The Heritage Foundation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Paul Dans served as Chief of Staff at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) during the Trump administration, managing federal HR policies for over two million workers. He also worked closely with the Office of Presidential Personnel as OPM’s White House liaison. Before OPM, Dans was a Senior Advisor at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. He has a legal background, having practiced high-stakes commercial litigation for 15 years before founding his own firm. Dans holds degrees from the University of Virginia School of Law and MIT.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Dans played a significant role in the Trump administration as Chief of Staff at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management from February 2020 to December 2020. His responsibilities included liaising with the White House to help fill positions for approximately 4,000 presidential appointees across the federal government. He is currently the director of Project 2025, which continues the policies and strategies from his tenure, aligning with the Trump administration’s goals.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Dans has not been personally involved in major scandals. However, Project 2025, which he directs, has faced scrutiny for its ambitious agenda to overhaul federal agencies in line with conservative principles. The project’s goals have led to criticism and concern about its potential impact on federal governance.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Dans’ leadership in Project 2025, with its focus on reshaping federal agencies, may raise concerns about its impact on government stability and effectiveness. The project’s alignment with deregulatory goals from the Trump administration has sparked debate and opposition from various groups.</p>
