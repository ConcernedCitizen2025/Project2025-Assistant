<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Managing Director of Transportation Policy at the Reason Foundation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Baruch Feigenbaum is the Senior Managing Director of Transportation Policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank that advocates for free-market solutions in public policy. He specializes in various aspects of transportation policy, including infrastructure, public transit, highways, and transportation funding. Feigenbaum has been a vocal proponent of public-private partnerships and market-based approaches to improving transportation systems. He holds a Master’s degree in Transportation Planning from the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
While Baruch Feigenbaum did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, his work at the Reason Foundation aligns with many of the administration’s policy goals, particularly in the areas of deregulation and infrastructure investment. The Trump administration’s emphasis on public-private partnerships and infrastructure investment reflects principles similar to those promoted by Feigenbaum and the Reason Foundation.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Baruch Feigenbaum has not been involved in any major personal scandals. His work at the Reason Foundation, however, is often at the center of public debates regarding the role of privatization in public infrastructure. The foundation’s advocacy for reduced government involvement and increased private sector participation in infrastructure projects is sometimes criticized for prioritizing profit over public interest, potentially leading to reduced accessibility and equity in transportation services.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Feigenbaum’s advocacy for privatization and market-based solutions in transportation can be controversial. Critics argue that such policies may prioritize profit over public interest, potentially leading to reduced accessibility and equity in transportation services. Debates over funding mechanisms such as tolling and public-private partnerships often attract significant public and political scrutiny, with concerns about their long-term impact on public infrastructure.</p>
