<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Legal Fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
George Fishman is a Senior Legal Fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a think tank advocating for reduced immigration levels and stricter immigration enforcement. Fishman has extensive experience in immigration law and policy, having served as Deputy General Counsel at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the Trump administration. Before DHS, he worked as Chief Counsel for the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security. He holds a JD from Yale Law School and a BA from Princeton University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Fishman played a key role in the Trump administration’s efforts to implement stricter immigration policies. As Deputy General Counsel at DHS, he was deeply involved in advising on legal issues related to immigration enforcement and policy development, aligning closely with the administration’s goals. His current role at CIS continues to support and promote similar immigration policies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Fishman has been involved in several controversial policy debates, particularly during his tenure at DHS. The Trump administration’s immigration policies, including family separations and increased deportations, were highly controversial, attracting significant public outcry. Fishman’s involvement in these policies makes him a prominent figure in these contentious discussions. More recently, his positions on the legal status of hiring undocumented immigrants at public universities have also sparked debate.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Fishman’s strong advocacy for stricter immigration controls and enforcement is highly contentious. Critics argue that the policies he supports may contribute to harsh treatment of immigrants and undermine the rights of undocumented individuals, leading to significant opposition from immigrant rights groups and advocates.</p>
