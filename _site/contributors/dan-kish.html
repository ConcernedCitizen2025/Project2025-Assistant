<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Vice President of Policy, Institute for Energy Research (IER)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Dan Kish serves as the Senior Vice President of Policy at the Institute for Energy Research (IER), where he advocates for energy policies that promote the use of fossil fuels and deregulation of the energy sector. With over 25 years of experience working on congressional committees focused on natural resources and energy policies, Kish has held key roles, including Chief of Staff for the Republicans on the House Resources Committee and staff positions on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He also served as an energy and environmental policy adviser to former Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Dan Kish’s work at IER and his policy positions strongly align with the Trump administration’s stance on energy independence and deregulation. The Trump administration supported increased fossil fuel production and sought to reduce regulatory constraints, reflecting the principles Kish has long advocated. His role as a prominent commentator and adviser on energy issues further solidified this alignment, particularly in the context of Project 2025, which seeks to restore Trump-era policies and expand fossil fuel development.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
There are no major personal scandals associated with Dan Kish. However, his professional stance and public comments on energy policy, such as his claims regarding the U.S. having sufficient oil supply for 200 years, have sparked debates and criticism from environmental advocates and policymakers who support a transition to renewable energy. His strong advocacy for fossil fuels is often at odds with progressive climate policies, making him a polarizing figure in energy discussions.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Kish’s advocacy for extensive fossil fuel use and deregulation of the energy sector aligns with conservative views, but it can be contentious in the context of current environmental and climate change debates. Critics argue that his positions may undermine efforts to combat climate change and could favor industry interests over environmental protection and public health.</p>
