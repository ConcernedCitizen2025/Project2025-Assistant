<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Special Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Brian J. Cavanaugh served as a Special Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy during the Trump administration. In this role, he focused on various domestic policy issues, including healthcare, education, and economic reform. Cavanaugh holds a JD from Notre Dame Law School and a BA from the University of Notre Dame. His career in public policy and government provided him with significant experience in shaping and advising on domestic policies, which were central to the Trump administration’s agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Cavanaugh’s role as a Special Assistant to the President placed him directly within the Trump administration, where he was instrumental in advising on and implementing key domestic policies. These policies, particularly those related to healthcare and economic reform, were aligned with the broader objectives of the Trump administration. While there is no direct evidence linking Cavanaugh to Project 2025, his involvement in Trump’s domestic policy initiatives places him within the network of individuals who have shaped and supported similar conservative agendas.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Brian J. Cavanaugh has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his tenure in the Trump administration means his work was inherently connected to the broader controversies surrounding domestic policy decisions during that period. These decisions, particularly in healthcare and economic reform, were often criticized by opponents of the administration.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Cavanaugh’s involvement in the Trump administration’s domestic policy may draw scrutiny, especially from critics of the administration’s approach to healthcare, education, and economic inequality. His work in these areas reflects the contentious nature of the administration’s domestic agenda, which was frequently debated and challenged by both public and political entities.</p>
