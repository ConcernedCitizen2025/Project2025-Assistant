<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Trump EPA Official</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
David Harlow served as an official at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the Trump administration. He played a significant role in the agency’s policy and administrative operations, contributing to efforts aimed at regulatory reform and realigning the EPA’s mission to support conservative principles. Harlow has a background in environmental policy and regulatory affairs, with experience in managing and implementing substantial changes within the EPA.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
David Harlow’s role at the EPA under the Trump administration placed him at the heart of efforts to reduce regulatory burdens and shift the agency’s focus towards conservative goals. His work supported the administration’s agenda to streamline operations, emphasize state-level environmental management, and reduce the overall size and scope of the EPA. His involvement in Project 2025, a conservative policy initiative, further ties him to the ongoing effort to revive Trump-era policies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
David Harlow has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his role in the Trump EPA, particularly in advocating for a deregulatory agenda, has been contentious. Critics argue that the policies he supported often favored industrial interests over environmental protection and public health. Nonetheless, there are no notable controversies directly linked to him personally.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Harlow’s involvement in the Trump administration’s EPA and his continued advocacy for conservative realignment of the agency may attract scrutiny from environmental advocates and public health professionals. The deregulatory agenda he supported is often criticized for potentially compromising environmental standards and public health protections.</p>
