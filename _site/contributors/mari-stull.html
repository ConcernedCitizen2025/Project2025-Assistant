<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Senior Advisor, U.S. Department of State; Former Lobbyist and Wine Blogger</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Mari Stull, also known as the “Vino Vixen,” is a former lobbyist and wine blogger who served as a Senior Advisor at the U.S. Department of State during the Trump administration. Before joining the government, she was an international lobbyist for the food and beverage industry and became known for her wine blog, which she operated under the moniker “Vino Vixen.” At the State Department, Stull’s role involved scrutinizing and allegedly creating loyalty lists of career diplomats, leading to significant controversy and investigations into her actions.</p>

<p>Her tenure at the State Department was marked by allegations of workplace bullying and retaliation against employees perceived as disloyal to President Trump. Stull left the State Department in January 2019 amidst ongoing investigations. After her time in the government, she returned to work at the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture and continued to contribute to various conservative causes.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Mari Stull’s role as a Senior Advisor at the U.S. Department of State under the Trump administration closely aligns her with the Trump administration’s objectives and policies. Appointed by President Trump, Stull was known for her efforts to enforce the administration’s political alignment within the State Department. Her tenure was characterized by a strong focus on loyalty to Trump’s agenda, which included the controversial creation of loyalty lists and scrutiny of career diplomats who were perceived as not supportive of Trump’s policies.</p>

<p>Stull’s role was part of a broader effort to align the State Department’s staff with the President’s directives, reflecting the Trump administration’s approach to reshaping federal agencies according to its political goals. Her actions in managing and allegedly pressuring staff to conform to Trump’s agenda were consistent with the administration’s emphasis on loyalty and political alignment within government positions. This approach was part of Trump’s broader strategy to consolidate influence over various federal agencies and ensure that they reflected his administration’s priorities.</p>

<p>Stull’s departure from the State Department amid investigations into her conduct highlights the contentious and partisan nature of her role within the administration, as well as the broader controversies associated with Trump’s approach to staffing and policy enforcement.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Stull’s time at the State Department was controversial due to her alleged creation of loyalty lists and mistreatment of career diplomats, which drew investigations by federal watchdogs and criticism from Congress.</p>
