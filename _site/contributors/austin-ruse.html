<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> President, Center for Family and Human Rights (C-Fam)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Austin Ruse is a conservative activist and the president of the Center for Family and Human Rights (C-Fam), an organization known for its strong stances against abortion and LGBTQ rights. C-Fam, which has been classified as an anti-LGBTQ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, operates with the goal of influencing policy at the United Nations and other international forums. Ruse has been a vocal critic of progressive social policies and has authored several books attacking what he sees as “left-wing” ideologies.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Ruse is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump, often aligning with Trump’s views on social issues. His organization, C-Fam, has leveraged connections within the Trump administration to advocate for conservative policies on an international scale, particularly at the United Nations. Ruse’s involvement in Project 2025 is part of a broader effort to institutionalize conservative Christian values within the U.S. government, a vision that is closely aligned with the goals of Trump and his allies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Austin Ruse has been involved in several controversies, particularly regarding his extreme views on LGBTQ issues and his inflammatory rhetoric. He has publicly supported the criminalization of homosexuality and praised anti-gay legislation in Russia. Additionally, Ruse has made provocative statements, such as suggesting that liberal university administrators should be “taken out and shot,” which led to backlash and the resignation of a C-Fam board member. His alignment with Project 2025, a plan that includes proposals to dismantle existing federal structures and push conservative social agendas, has also drawn significant criticism.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Ruse’s extreme positions and his role in pushing for policies that could severely restrict reproductive and LGBTQ rights raise significant concerns. His involvement in Project 2025 suggests that he could play a key role in efforts to enact drastic changes in government policies, potentially leading to the rollback of many social freedoms currently protected by law.</p>
