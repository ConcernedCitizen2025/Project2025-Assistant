<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Executive Vice President at the Center for Family and Human Rights (C-Fam)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Lisa Correnti is the Executive Vice President at the Center for Family and Human Rights (C-Fam), where she focuses on international social policy with an emphasis on promoting pro-life and pro-family values at the United Nations and other international institutions. Correnti has been actively involved in advocating for these issues since she joined C-Fam in 2011. Before her tenure at C-Fam, she engaged in political activism at both the state and national levels, including roles such as the regional director for a parental notification bill in California and campaign manager for a pro-life congressional candidate. She holds a BA from Loyola Marymount University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Lisa Correnti’s work at C-Fam aligns with many of the social policy positions supported by the Trump administration, particularly in areas related to pro-life advocacy and traditional family values. Although she did not hold an official role in the Trump administration, her organization’s efforts to influence international policy on these issues often complemented the administration’s stance.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Lisa Correnti has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, her leadership role at C-Fam, an organization known for its strong opposition to reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ rights, often places her in the midst of significant public and political debates. C-Fam’s stance on these issues has led to criticism from progressive groups and human rights organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
C-Fam’s advocacy, particularly its opposition to LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights, is highly controversial. Critics argue that the organization’s efforts may undermine the rights of marginalized groups at international forums like the United Nations. Correnti’s leadership in these areas makes her a central figure in these contentious debates.</p>
