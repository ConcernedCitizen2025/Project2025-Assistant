<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Patrick T. Brown is a Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, where he focuses on family policy and social conservatism. His work is dedicated to developing a robust pro-family economic agenda that emphasizes the importance of families as the cornerstone of a healthy and flourishing society. Before joining EPPC, Brown served as a Senior Policy Advisor at the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) of the U.S. Congress, where he played a key role in shaping policy discussions on economic issues affecting American families. He holds a BA in Political Science and Economics from the University of Notre Dame and an MPP from Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
While Patrick T. Brown did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, his policy work aligns closely with many of the social and economic priorities championed by the administration. His research and advocacy at EPPC support conservative policy initiatives that were central to the Trump administration’s agenda, particularly in areas related to family and social policy.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Patrick T. Brown has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his work on social and family policy, particularly his advocacy for conservative approaches to family structure and child-rearing, can be polarizing. His policy recommendations often attract both support and criticism, reflecting broader ideological divides in debates over social policy.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Brown’s advocacy for traditional family structures and conservative social policies may draw criticism from those who hold differing views on social issues such as marriage, family dynamics, and government intervention in family life. His work is deeply rooted in conservative values, which can be contentious in broader discussions about social policy and family welfare.</p>
