<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Member, Board of Directors, America First Policy Institute</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Carla Sands is a businesswoman and former diplomat who served as the U.S. Ambassador to Denmark from 2017 to 2021 under President Donald Trump. During her ambassadorship, she played a critical role in strengthening U.S. ties in the Arctic, including the establishment of a U.S. consulate in Nuuk, Greenland. Prior to her diplomatic career, Sands was the Chairman and CEO of Vintage Capital Group, a real estate investment firm specializing in the redevelopment of underperforming assets. Her career also includes previous roles in acting and chiropractic medicine before transitioning into business and public service.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Sands’ appointment as Ambassador to Denmark was a direct result of her alignment with Trump’s “America First” policies. She remains connected to Trump’s legacy through her role on the Board of Directors at the America First Policy Institute, an organization committed to advancing the former president’s agenda on issues such as economic nationalism, deregulation, and conservative social policies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Carla Sands has not been directly involved in major scandals, but her tenure as Ambassador and her vocal support for Trump’s policies have not been without controversy. Her public comments, particularly a tweet criticizing high fuel prices and linking them to Biden administration policies, drew significant attention and criticism. Additionally, her leadership at the America First Policy Institute, an organization closely tied to Trump’s agenda, has been controversial among those who oppose the continuation of his policies.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Sands’ involvement with the America First Policy Institute raises concerns about the organization’s influence on future U.S. policies. Critics argue that the institute’s agenda, which includes significant deregulation and a focus on economic nationalism, could further polarize the political landscape and potentially isolate the U.S. from international allies.</p>
