<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Fellow at the American Federation for Children (AFC)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Corey DeAngelis is a Senior Fellow at the American Federation for Children, where he advocates for school choice and educational reform. He is a prominent figure in the education policy arena, known for his strong support of school vouchers, charter schools, and other mechanisms that promote parental choice in education. DeAngelis holds a PhD in Education Policy from the University of Arkansas and has authored numerous publications on educational choice and reform.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Corey DeAngelis’s work at the American Federation for Children aligns closely with the education policies promoted by the Trump administration, particularly those advocated by former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. The Trump administration’s emphasis on expanding school choice, including vouchers and charter schools, resonates with DeAngelis’s research and advocacy efforts. Although he did not hold a formal position within the Trump administration, his work supports and complements its education policy agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Corey DeAngelis has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his strong advocacy for school choice and educational reform has placed him at the center of ongoing debates about the future of public education in the United States. These debates, often politically charged, attract both strong support and significant opposition depending on perspectives on education policy.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
DeAngelis’s advocacy for school choice and educational vouchers is often controversial. Critics argue that such policies can divert funding from public schools, potentially undermining the public education system and increasing educational inequality. Supporters of public education and teachers’ unions frequently oppose the policies DeAngelis promotes, arguing that they do not address the root causes of educational disparities.</p>
