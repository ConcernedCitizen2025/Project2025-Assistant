<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Founder and CEO, Keystone Policy</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Bethany Kozma is the founder and CEO of Keystone Policy, a nonprofit organization focused on policies that protect life, religious liberty, and the family. Kozma has extensive experience in government service, having served in senior executive roles in the Trump administration, including Deputy Chief of Staff at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Her career also includes roles in the White House during the George W. Bush administration, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Intelligence Community.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Bethany Kozma’s work closely aligns with the Trump administration’s policies on family life and religious liberties. She played a pivotal role in ensuring that global investments aligned with the National Security Strategy objectives during her time at USAID. Her public statements and policy positions are consistent with the conservative values promoted by the Trump administration. Recently, Kozma has been involved in Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative closely associated with Trump-aligned policies. In this role, she has advocated for significant changes in government policy, particularly around issues like climate change and gender ideology.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Kozma has faced backlash for her conservative views and policy advocacy. Her opposition to comprehensive sexuality education and her comments at international forums, such as the United Nations, where she declared the U.S. as a pro-life nation, have been subjects of controversy. Additionally, her involvement in Project 2025 has drawn criticism, particularly for her statements on climate change, which she has downplayed as a pretext for population control. This has sparked significant debate, especially among environmental and progressive groups.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Kozma’s advocacy for pro-life and conservative family values, including her outspoken stance against comprehensive sexuality education funded by USAID, has been controversial. Her positions on gender identity policies and her criticisms of certain educational programs have attracted significant public and political debate.</p>
