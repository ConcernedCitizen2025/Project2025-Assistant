<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Executive Director of the National Space Council</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Mark Albrecht served as the Executive Director of the National Space Council under President George H.W. Bush from 1989 to 1992. In this role, he was the principal advisor on space policy, playing a key role in shaping U.S. space strategy during a critical period marked by the end of the Cold War and the Space Exploration Initiative. After his government service, Albrecht transitioned to the private sector, where he held leadership roles, including President of Lockheed Martin’s International Launch Services (ILS) from 1999 to 2006. He also served as Senior Vice President at Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and was involved in space policy and operations for over three decades. Albrecht holds a PhD in Public Policy Analysis from the RAND Graduate School and a BA and MA in History from UCLA.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Although Mark Albrecht did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, his earlier work as Executive Director of the National Space Council provided a historical foundation for the re-establishment of the council under Vice President Mike Pence. His influence on space policy during the George H.W. Bush administration likely contributed to the Trump administration’s approach to space exploration and national space strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Mark Albrecht has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, his significant roles in both the public and private sectors, particularly his work with major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, have sometimes drawn attention regarding the intersection of public space policy and private industry interests.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Albrecht’s deep involvement in both government and private sector space initiatives might raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the influence of private industry on public space policy. His leadership in shaping space policy during critical times, such as the end of the Cold War, has been both lauded and scrutinized, particularly in how these policies have influenced modern space exploration efforts.</p>
