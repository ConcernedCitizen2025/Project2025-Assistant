<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> American Principles Project</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Adam Korzeniewski is a combat veteran of the United States Marine Corps who has served in various roles within the Trump administration, specifically in the Treasury Department and Commerce Department. His extensive experience covers financial policy, trade, industrial policy, national security, and the census. After his time in government, Korzeniewski became associated with the American Principles Project, an organization focused on conservative advocacy, particularly on family and social issues. He was also appointed by Trump to the Presidential Council for Improving Federal Civic Architecture in 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Korzeniewski’s work in the Trump administration and his role at the American Principles Project align him closely with the policies and political strategies endorsed by the Trump administration. The American Principles Project has supported numerous initiatives reflecting Trump’s stance on family and social issues, further illustrating this alignment.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Super PAC Involvement:</strong> Korzeniewski has been linked to the creation of a Super PAC aimed at promoting conservative candidates and causes. This initiative is part of a broader effort to establish a conservative ecosystem free from liberal influence, sparking debate and concern among various political groups.</li>
  <li><strong>Election Integrity Advocacy:</strong> His advocacy efforts, particularly around issues like election integrity, have placed him at the center of contentious political debates. His association with figures and organizations promoting conservative social policies has led to significant criticism and opposition.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Korzeniewski’s involvement with the American Principles Project aligns him with a conservative agenda that often involves contentious social and political issues. His work has been polarizing, attracting both support and criticism, particularly from those on opposite ends of the political spectrum.</p>
