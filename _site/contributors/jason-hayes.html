<p><strong>Position:</strong> Director of Environmental Policy at Mackinac Center for Public Policy</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Jason Hayes serves as the Director of Environmental Policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a free-market think tank based in Michigan. He has extensive experience in environmental policy, with a focus on promoting free-market environmentalism and opposing what he views as overregulation. Hayes has nearly three decades of experience in the field, having worked as a backcountry ranger and forester in British Columbia before transitioning to policy research and advocacy in the United States and Canada. He holds a Master of Environmental Design from the University of Calgary and a Bachelor of Science in Natural Resource Conservation from the University of British Columbia.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
While there is no direct link between Jason Hayes and the Trump administration, his advocacy for deregulation and free-market environmental policies aligns with the broader conservative agenda that was prominent during Trump’s presidency. The Mackinac Center, where Hayes works, is known for supporting policies that favor limited government intervention, which echoes many of the principles endorsed by Trump.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Jason Hayes has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his work in environmental policy, particularly his opposition to green energy mandates and regulations, often places him in the center of public and political debates. His stance on issues like energy policy and environmental regulations is contentious and has sparked significant opposition from environmental groups and public health advocates.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Hayes’s advocacy for free-market environmental policies can be contentious. Critics argue that his positions may favor industrial and corporate interests at the expense of environmental protection. His work often involves challenging environmental regulations, which can attract significant opposition from environmental groups and public health advocates.</p>
