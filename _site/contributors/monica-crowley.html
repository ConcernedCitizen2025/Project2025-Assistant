<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, U.S. Department of the Treasury</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Monica Crowley served as the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury from 2019 to 2021 during the Trump administration. In this role, she led the department’s communications strategy through critical periods, including the economic expansion, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the subsequent economic recovery. Her work earned her the Alexander Hamilton Award, the Treasury Department’s highest honor. Before her tenure at the Treasury, Crowley was a well-known conservative commentator and political analyst, with appearances on Fox News, ABC News, and other media outlets. She also authored several books and served as a foreign policy assistant to former President Richard Nixon. Crowley holds a Ph.D. in International Relations from Columbia University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Monica Crowley was closely aligned with the Trump administration, both in her role at the Treasury Department and as a public supporter of Trump’s political agenda. Her work involved promoting and defending the administration’s economic policies, making her an integral part of Trump’s communications team during her tenure.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Crowley has been involved in several controversies, most notably a plagiarism scandal in 2017, where she was accused of plagiarizing portions of her 2012 book and her Ph.D. dissertation. This controversy led her to withdraw from a previously appointed role as Senior Director of Strategic Communications for the National Security Council. Despite these issues, she remained a prominent figure in conservative circles and continued her career in government.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Crowley’s past controversies, particularly the plagiarism allegations, continue to be a point of scrutiny. Additionally, her strong advocacy for Trump-era policies and her aggressive media presence have made her a polarizing figure in public discourse.</p>
