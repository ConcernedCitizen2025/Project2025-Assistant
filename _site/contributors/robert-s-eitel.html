<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> President and Co-Founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Robert S. Eitel is the President and Co-Founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies, a nonprofit organization that promotes conservative education and labor policies. Prior to founding the institute, Eitel served as Senior Counselor to the Secretary of Education under Betsy DeVos during the Trump administration. His work during this time focused on education policy, regulatory reform, and labor issues, aligning with the administration’s goals of reducing federal oversight and promoting school choice. Eitel holds a JD from Tulane University Law School and a BA from Georgetown University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Robert S. Eitel’s role as Senior Counselor to the Secretary of Education under Betsy DeVos directly tied him to the Trump administration. His work involved advising on key education policies and regulatory reforms that were central to the administration’s agenda. His current role at the Defense of Freedom Institute continues to support and advocate for policies that align with the principles championed by the Trump administration, particularly in the areas of education and labor.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Robert S. Eitel has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his tenure at the Department of Education under Betsy DeVos placed him in the midst of highly contentious policy debates. The policies he supported, especially those related to deregulation and school choice, were and continue to be subjects of significant public and political scrutiny.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Eitel’s work at the Department of Education and his role in founding the Defense of Freedom Institute position him at the center of contentious debates over education policy and labor regulations. Critics argue that his advocacy for deregulation in these areas could undermine protections for students and workers. Additionally, his close association with Betsy DeVos, who faced substantial opposition during her tenure as Secretary of Education, may draw continued scrutiny from those who opposed the Trump administration’s education policies.</p>
