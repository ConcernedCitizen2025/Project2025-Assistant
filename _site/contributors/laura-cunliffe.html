<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Fellow at the Independent Women’s Forum (IWF)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Laura Cunliffe is a Senior Fellow at the Independent Women’s Forum (IWF), where she focuses on issues of administrative reform and regulatory change. Before joining IWF, she served as Executive Director and Vice President of Policy at Family Watch International (FWI), an organization with consultative status at the United Nations. Cunliffe also held significant roles in the Trump administration, including Chief of Staff to Ambassador Andrew P. Bremberg at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in Geneva. Her experience spans various sectors, including education, where she began her career as a Teach for America teacher.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Cunliffe’s work aligns closely with the conservative policy agenda that was prominent during the Trump administration. Her roles in the administration, particularly at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations and the White House Office of Management and Budget, placed her at the heart of policy-making processes that supported the administration’s goals.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Laura Cunliffe has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, her association with organizations like Family Watch International, known for its conservative stances on family and health issues, and her work during the Trump administration have placed her in the midst of ongoing public debates. These roles often attract scrutiny, particularly from critics of the policies she supports.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Cunliffe’s advocacy at IWF and her prior roles in the Trump administration can be contentious, especially given the conservative and sometimes polarizing nature of the policies she promotes. Her involvement in these areas has drawn criticism from those who oppose the positions taken by the organizations she represents.</p>
