<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Kevin E. Moley is an American businessman and diplomat who served in several key government roles. He was the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs from 2018 to 2019 during the Trump administration. Previously, he served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations International Organizations in Geneva from 2001 to 2006 under President George W. Bush. Moley’s career also includes senior positions in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and service as a U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Kevin E. Moley’s role as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs under President Trump was central to shaping U.S. foreign policy regarding international organizations, including the United Nations. Appointed by Trump, Moley was responsible for overseeing the U.S. approach to multilateral institutions and international cooperation. His position involved significant influence over how the U.S. engaged with and challenged international organizations, aligning with Trump’s broader foreign policy objectives of reshaping global institutions and reducing U.S. involvement in international agreements deemed unfavorable to American interests. Moley’s tenure was characterized by efforts to assert U.S. interests and reform international organizations, reflecting Trump’s “America First” approach to foreign policy.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Moley’s leadership at the State Department faced criticism as reported in an Inspector General’s report, which highlighted issues of “disrespectful and hostile treatment” of staff. These issues, coupled with his failure to meet leadership standards, contributed to his resignation from the position in November 2019.</p>
