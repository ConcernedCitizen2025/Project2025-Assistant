<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Professor of Finance at the University of Colorado Boulder</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Sanjai Bhagat is a Professor of Finance at the University of Colorado Boulder’s Leeds School of Business. His research focuses on corporate governance, finance, and law. Bhagat has published extensively in academic journals and has contributed to discussions on corporate governance reforms and the role of boards in financial oversight. He has advised various government agencies on finance and corporate governance and has held teaching positions at Princeton University and the University of Chicago. Bhagat holds a PhD in Finance from the University of Washington and a BTech from the Indian Institute of Technology.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Sanjai Bhagat does not have a direct connection to the Trump administration. His work as an academic and researcher in finance and corporate governance is independent of any political administration. However, his research on corporate governance and financial regulation is relevant to discussions on economic policies that were central to the Trump administration’s agenda, particularly those related to deregulation and corporate oversight.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Sanjai Bhagat has not been involved in any personal scandals. His academic work and publications are generally respected, though, like any scholar in the field of finance, his positions and recommendations can generate debate and discussion among peers and policymakers. His views on corporate governance and the role of regulatory bodies have been subjects of academic and public debate, particularly in the context of broader discussions on corporate responsibility and regulation.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Bhagat’s academic work often emphasizes the importance of strong corporate governance and the role of financial oversight in preventing corporate malfeasance. While generally well-regarded, his positions advocating for specific governance reforms can be contentious among those who prefer different regulatory approaches or less intervention in corporate affairs. His work is significant in the ongoing debates over corporate governance, particularly in light of high-profile corporate failures and financial crises.</p>
