<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Mark H. Buzby is a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who served as the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) from August 2017 to January 2021 under the Trump administration. Prior to his role at MARAD, Buzby had a distinguished 34-year career in the U.S. Navy, where he held various command and staff positions, including Commander of the Military Sealift Command (MSC) from 2009 to 2013. He also commanded Joint Task Force Guantanamo and Destroyer Squadron 31. Buzby earned a Bachelor of Science in Nautical Science from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and holds master’s degrees in Strategic Studies and International Relations from the U.S. Naval War College and Salve Regina University, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Mark Buzby’s appointment as Administrator of MARAD by President Trump directly connected him to the administration’s transportation and infrastructure agenda. His leadership focused on revitalizing the U.S. Merchant Marine and enhancing maritime infrastructure, aligning with Trump’s broader goals of strengthening American industry and national security.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Mark Buzby resigned from his position as Administrator of MARAD on January 11, 2021, following the Capitol riot on January 6. He cited his inability to continue serving in the administration while remaining true to his values as the reason for his resignation. Apart from this resignation, there are no major personal scandals associated with Buzby. His tenure was primarily focused on operational and administrative improvements within the maritime sector, which, while occasionally contentious, did not lead to significant controversies.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Buzby’s extensive interactions with the maritime industry, including his previous role as President of the National Defense Transportation Association, might raise concerns about the influence of private industry on public maritime policy. However, his career has been largely marked by efforts to enhance national security through maritime strength and efficiency.</p>
