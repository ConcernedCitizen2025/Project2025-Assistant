<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Fellow, Independent Institute</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Judy Shelton is a renowned economist and Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute. She has held various influential positions, including Chairman of the National Endowment for Democracy and U.S. Director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Shelton is widely recognized for her advocacy of sound money principles and her criticisms of the Federal Reserve, often advocating for a return to the gold standard.</p>

<p>Shelton has served as an economic advisor to the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform and was a key economic advisor to Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. In February 2020, Trump nominated her to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, although her nomination faced significant controversy and was ultimately not confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Judy Shelton played a prominent role in advising Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign on monetary policy and economic reform. Her nomination to the Federal Reserve Board by Trump further solidified her connection to the administration, although the nomination process was met with resistance due to her unconventional views on monetary policy.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Shelton’s nomination to the Federal Reserve Board was controversial, primarily due to her support for the gold standard and her critiques of the Federal Reserve’s policies. Despite strong backing from Trump, her nomination failed to secure enough votes in the Senate.</p>
