<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Executive Director and CEO of the American Cornerstone Institute</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Andrew Hughes is the Executive Director and CEO of the American Cornerstone Institute (ACI), an organization founded by Dr. Ben Carson to promote conservative principles based on faith, liberty, community, and life. Hughes has a background in government, having previously served as Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the Trump administration. His role at HUD involved significant policy oversight and management responsibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Hughes’s tenure at HUD during the Trump administration directly ties him to Trump’s policies and administrative strategies. His leadership at ACI continues to reflect the conservative values championed by Trump, and his work at the institute involves projects that align closely with Trump-era priorities, such as promoting conservative staffing within the federal government through initiatives like the “Executive Branch for America” program.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
There are no major personal scandals associated with Andrew Hughes. His professional focus has been on policy development and organizational leadership within conservative circles. While his work is sometimes controversial in public discourse, particularly in the context of promoting conservative staffing in government, there have been no notable personal controversies linked to him.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Hughes’s work at ACI, particularly in promoting conservative values and education, can attract criticism from those who oppose such viewpoints. The institute’s initiatives, like encouraging more conservative representation in government, may be seen as controversial, especially in a politically divided environment.</p>
