<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Director of Policy at the Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Rachel Bovard is the Senior Director of Policy at the Conservative Partnership Institute, a key organization focused on training and supporting conservative staff and elected officials. Bovard has over a decade of experience in policy and legislative strategy, having served in significant roles in the U.S. Senate, including as Legislative Director for Senator Rand Paul and Policy Director for the Senate Steering Committee. She is a recognized commentator on conservative policy issues and has been featured in various media outlets including <em>The Federalist</em>, Fox News, and <em>The New York Times</em>. Bovard holds a BA from Grove City College and an MA from The George Washington University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Rachel Bovard’s work aligns closely with many of the Trump administration’s priorities, particularly in areas such as deregulation, judicial appointments, and conservative social policies. Although she did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, her influence within conservative policy circles and her work with organizations that support Trump’s agenda make her a significant player in advancing Trump-aligned policies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Rachel Bovard has not been involved in any major personal scandals. Her work at CPI and her advocacy for conservative policies can be polarizing, especially among those who oppose her positions. She often finds herself at the center of debates over key legislative issues, which leads to intense scrutiny and public discourse.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Bovard’s strong advocacy for conservative reforms and her strategic role in shaping legislative efforts may attract criticism from progressive groups and others who disagree with her policy positions. Her involvement with CPI, which plays a pivotal role in supporting conservative lawmakers, places her in the midst of significant policy debates that can be contentious.</p>
