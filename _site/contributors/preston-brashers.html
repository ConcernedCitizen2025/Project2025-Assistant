<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Policy Analyst, Tax Policy at The Heritage Foundation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Preston Brashers is a Senior Policy Analyst specializing in tax policy at The Heritage Foundation, where he works in the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget. His research focuses on promoting economic growth, simplifying tax codes, and advocating for reduced government intervention. Before joining The Heritage Foundation, Brashers worked as a Tax Policy Specialist at the Washington State Department of Revenue and as a manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he provided tax consulting services to multinational companies. He holds a PhD in Economics from the University of Kentucky and a BA in Economics from the University of Washington.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Preston Brashers’ policy work aligns closely with many of the economic priorities of the Trump administration, such as tax cuts and deregulation. Although he did not hold a formal role in the Trump administration, his advocacy for policies like those implemented in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 supports the broader economic goals pursued during Trump’s presidency.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Preston Brashers has not been involved in any major personal scandals. His policy positions, however, particularly his advocacy for lower taxes and reduced government spending, are often contentious. These positions can generate significant public and political debate, especially regarding their impact on income inequality and social programs.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Brashers’ work at The Heritage Foundation emphasizes fiscal austerity, lower taxes, and limited government intervention. Critics argue that such policies may disproportionately benefit the wealthy and could exacerbate income inequality. His focus on reducing federal spending is also controversial, particularly in discussions about funding for social programs and public services.</p>
