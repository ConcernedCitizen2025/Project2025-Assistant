<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Vice President, CGCN Group</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Aaron Szabo is the Senior Vice President at CGCN Group, a government relations and lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C. Szabo has extensive experience in public policy and legal affairs, particularly in the areas of energy, environmental regulation, and corporate compliance. Before joining CGCN, Szabo held various roles in the federal government, including positions at the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). His career has been marked by his involvement in significant regulatory reforms and his advocacy for industry-friendly policies.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Szabo’s work closely aligns with the deregulatory agenda pursued by the Trump administration. During his time at the OMB, he played a crucial role in advancing Trump’s regulatory rollback efforts, particularly those aimed at reducing environmental regulations perceived as burdensome to businesses. His contributions to Project 2025 reflect his ongoing commitment to shaping policies that favor deregulation and economic growth, which were central to Trump’s policy initiatives.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
There are no significant scandals or controversies associated with Aaron Szabo. His work has primarily focused on regulatory policy and advocacy, which, while sometimes contentious in the policy arena, has not been personally or professionally controversial.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Szabo’s strong advocacy for deregulation, particularly in the environmental sector, may raise concerns among those who prioritize stringent environmental protections. Critics may argue that his approach could lead to weakened regulatory oversight and increased risks to public health and the environment. As a contributor to Project 2025, Szabo’s influence could be significant in shaping future conservative policies in these areas.</p>
