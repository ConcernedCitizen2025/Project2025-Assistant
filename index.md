# Welcome to the *Project 2025 Assistant*

In these tumultuous times, many of us find ourselves grappling with a series of unprecedented events: the COVID-19 pandemic, the Capitol insurrection, contentious Supreme Court decisions, and now, Project 2025. The current state of affairs often feels surreal, like something out of a dystopian film.

My journey into understanding Project 2025 began in late June when I first encountered mentions of it. Intrigued, I embarked on a thorough investigation, initially using the free version of ChatGPT to analyze the document in segments. This preliminary exploration yielded fascinating insights, which I compiled into a PDF and shared with friends and family. Their interest was piqued, but it only raised more questions.

Determined to delve deeper, I upgraded to the paid version of ChatGPT and uploaded the entire Project 2025 document. I conducted a more comprehensive analysis, repeating my previous methodology but with greater depth. Each iteration of this process only fueled my curiosity further, eventually leading me to undertake a deep, systematic analysis of Project 2025 with the intention of sharing my findings with a broader audience.

Over the following months, I dedicated countless hours to this project. My research expanded to include in-depth investigations into the authors, editors, and contributors of Project 2025, as well as the organizations represented on its advisory board. I meticulously analyzed each section of the document and formulated over 150 probing questions to further my understanding.

The result of this labor is a comprehensive breakdown of Project 2025. For each section, I provide summaries, analyses, potential concerns, and notable quotes. I've made every effort to ensure accuracy, including proper citations to aid readers in locating specific information within the original 900-page document, titled *Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise*.

It's important to note that while I've strived for accuracy, there may be instances of human error or AI misinterpretation. I encourage readers to approach this information critically and to refer to the original document, available for download on the <a href="https://www.project2025.org/playbook/">Project 2025 website</a>, for verification.

My goal in creating this resource is to make the contents of Project 2025 more accessible to those who may not have the time or inclination to read the entire document. By providing this breakdown, I hope to shed light on the proposed policies and their potential implications for the upcoming presidential election.

Thank you for visiting my site. I hope this analysis proves valuable in your understanding of Project 2025 and its significance in shaping future policies.
