# Welcome to the *Project 2025 Assistant*

In these tumultuous times, many of us find ourselves grappling with a series of unprecedented events: the COVID-19 pandemic, the Capitol insurrection, contentious Supreme Court decisions, and now, **Project 2025**. The current state of affairs often feels surreal, like something out of a dystopian film.

## The Journey into Understanding Project 2025

The journey into understanding Project 2025 began in late June upon first encountering mentions of it. Intrigued, I embarked on a thorough investigation, initially using the free version of ChatGPT to analyze the document in segments. This preliminary exploration yielded fascinating insights, which were compiled into a PDF and shared with friends and family. Their interest was piqued, but it only raised more questions.

## A Deep Dive into Project 2025

Determined to delve deeper, I upgraded to the paid version of ChatGPT and uploaded the entire Project 2025 document. The analysis process was repeated and expanded, employing the initial methodology with increased depth and comprehensiveness. Each iteration of this process only fueled my curiosity further, eventually leading me to undertake a **deep, systematic analysis** of Project 2025 with the intention of sharing the findings with a broader audience.

## Hundreds of Hours of Research

Over the subsequent months, I dedicated countless hours to this project. The research expanded to include **in-depth investigations** into the authors, editors, and contributors of Project 2025, as well as the organizations represented on its advisory board. A meticulous analysis of each section yielded over **150 incisive questions**, delving deep into the document's implications and potential impacts on the future of American democracy.
