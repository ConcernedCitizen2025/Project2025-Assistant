<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
Section 3.13 of Project 2025 discusses the restructuring and reorientation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to align with conservative principles. The proposal emphasizes a shift towards cooperative federalism, where state and local governments take the lead in environmental regulation, with the federal EPA offering support and resources. The plan advocates for reducing the EPA’s regulatory reach, streamlining its operations, and focusing on tangible environmental outcomes rather than broad regulatory mandates. The section also calls for the elimination of certain EPA offices and programs, such as the Office of Environmental Justice and the Office of Public Engagement, and suggests significant budget cuts and personnel downsizing.</p>

<p><strong>In-Depth Analysis:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Cooperative Federalism and State Leadership:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Policy Proposal:</strong> The EPA should adopt a supportive role, allowing state and local governments to lead in environmental regulation. This approach is framed as respecting the principle of federalism and empowering local authorities who are seen as more attuned to the specific needs of their communities.</li>
      <li><strong>Concerning Implications:</strong> While cooperative federalism can foster local innovation, it may also lead to inconsistent environmental protections across states, particularly where local governments lack resources or have weaker environmental standards. The decentralization of environmental authority could result in a patchwork of regulations, potentially weakening national standards for air and water quality.</li>
      <li><strong>Potential Consequences:</strong> A reduction in federal oversight might allow states with less stringent regulations to prioritize economic development over environmental protection, leading to increased pollution and environmental degradation in certain regions. This could also create disparities in public health outcomes, particularly for marginalized communities that may lack political influence at the state level.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Streamlining the EPA and Reducing Regulatory Burdens:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Policy Proposal:</strong> The section calls for significant streamlining of the EPA, including the elimination of duplicative or wasteful programs, and a focus on practical, cost-effective solutions to environmental problems. This includes cutting down on what is perceived as overregulation that stifles economic growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Concerning Implications:</strong> While reducing unnecessary regulations can be beneficial, there is a risk that essential environmental protections could be weakened or removed under the guise of streamlining. The emphasis on cost-effectiveness may prioritize short-term economic gains over long-term environmental sustainability and public health.</li>
      <li><strong>Potential Consequences:</strong> Weakening regulations could lead to increased pollution, which would have long-term negative impacts on the environment and public health. Additionally, industries might prioritize profit over safety and environmental stewardship, resulting in more frequent and severe environmental disasters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Elimination of the Office of Environmental Justice:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Policy Proposal:</strong> The proposal suggests eliminating the Office of Environmental Justice and integrating its functions into other EPA offices, arguing that this would reduce redundancy and increase efficiency.</li>
      <li><strong>Concerning Implications:</strong> The elimination of this office could reduce the focus on addressing environmental injustices that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Environmental justice efforts are crucial for ensuring that all communities, regardless of socioeconomic status, have access to clean air, water, and land.</li>
      <li><strong>Potential Consequences:</strong> Without a dedicated office, environmental justice initiatives may receive less attention and funding, exacerbating existing inequalities. Communities that are already vulnerable to environmental hazards could face increased risks, with fewer resources to advocate for their rights and protections.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Restructuring the EPA’s Science and Research Activities:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Policy Proposal:</strong> The section advocates for the reduction or elimination of certain scientific programs within the EPA that are deemed unnecessary or not explicitly authorized by Congress. It also calls for increased transparency and public involvement in the scientific processes that inform EPA regulations.</li>
      <li><strong>Concerning Implications:</strong> While transparency and accountability in science are important, the proposed cuts to scientific programs could hinder the EPA’s ability to conduct comprehensive environmental research. This could lead to regulations that are less informed by science and more influenced by political and economic considerations.</li>
      <li><strong>Potential Consequences:</strong> A reduction in scientific research could impair the EPA’s ability to respond effectively to emerging environmental challenges, such as climate change and pollution. The emphasis on eliminating “unauthorized” science could lead to a decline in the quality and reliability of environmental regulations, ultimately compromising public health and safety.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Budget Cuts and Downsizing:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Policy Proposal:</strong> The section proposes significant budget cuts and downsizing within the EPA, with the goal of reducing the agency’s size and scope. This includes cutting funding for programs that do not directly contribute to the EPA’s core mission of protecting public health and the environment.</li>
      <li><strong>Concerning Implications:</strong> While fiscal responsibility is important, drastic budget cuts could severely limit the EPA’s ability to carry out its mission. Reduced funding could lead to understaffing, which would impair the agency’s ability to enforce environmental laws and respond to environmental emergencies.</li>
      <li><strong>Potential Consequences:</strong> Budget cuts could result in fewer inspections, less enforcement of environmental laws, and slower responses to environmental crises. This could increase the risk of pollution and environmental damage, particularly in areas that are already vulnerable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Day One Executive Order:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Policy Proposal:</strong> The section outlines a “Day One Executive Order” that the incoming President should issue to initiate the proposed restructuring of the EPA. This order would pause and review existing regulations, grant programs, and other activities to align them with the new administration’s priorities.</li>
      <li><strong>Concerning Implications:</strong> The broad scope of this executive order could lead to a significant rollback of existing environmental protections, especially those related to climate change and pollution control. The emphasis on aligning with the administration’s priorities may result in the politicization of environmental regulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Potential Consequences:</strong> A sweeping review and rollback of regulations could create uncertainty for businesses and communities, disrupt ongoing environmental protection efforts, and undermine public trust in the EPA. The emphasis on immediate changes could also lead to hasty decisions that overlook the long-term implications for the environment and public health.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion Statement:</strong>
The proposals outlined in the “Environmental Protection Agency” section of Project 2025 reflect a broader agenda to reduce the federal government’s role in environmental regulation, shifting more responsibility to state and local governments. While this approach emphasizes cooperative federalism and cost-effectiveness, it raises significant concerns about the potential weakening of environmental protections, reduced focus on environmental justice, and the undermining of scientific research. The proposed restructuring and budget cuts could impair the EPA’s ability to fulfill its mission of protecting public health and the environment, with serious consequences for the environment, public health, and long-term sustainability. As these policies are considered, it is crucial to ensure that they do not compromise the EPA’s ability to address the complex and evolving environmental challenges facing the nation.</p>

<h2 id="potential-concerns-environmental-protection-agency">Potential Concerns: Environmental Protection Agency</h2>

<h3 id="environmental-degradation">Environmental Degradation</h3>
<p>The emphasis on reducing regulatory burdens raises significant concerns about environmental degradation. Regulations are often designed to prevent pollution, protect ecosystems, and ensure public health. By scaling back these protections, there is a risk of increased air and water pollution, loss of biodiversity, and deterioration of natural habitats. The long-term environmental costs of such degradation could far outweigh any short-term economic benefits derived from deregulation.</p>

<h3 id="public-health-risks">Public Health Risks</h3>
<p>Weakened environmental regulations can lead to significant public health risks. Increased pollution from industrial activities, reduced air and water quality, and exposure to hazardous substances can result in respiratory issues, waterborne diseases, and other health problems for communities. Vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions, are particularly at risk. Ensuring stringent environmental standards is crucial for protecting public health.</p>

<h3 id="inconsistent-environmental-protections">Inconsistent Environmental Protections</h3>
<p>Empowering state-level control over environmental regulations can lead to inconsistent protections across the country. States with fewer resources or less stringent policies may become hotspots for industrial pollution, undermining national environmental goals. Additionally, environmental issues such as air and water pollution often cross state lines, necessitating coordinated federal oversight to address these challenges effectively.</p>

<h3 id="reduced-federal-oversight">Reduced Federal Oversight</h3>
<p>The shift towards state-level control and reduced federal oversight could weaken the EPA’s ability to enforce environmental laws and regulations consistently. States may lack the resources, expertise, or political will to enforce stringent environmental standards. This could lead to a patchwork of regulations and enforcement practices, creating an uneven playing field and potentially compromising environmental quality.</p>

<h3 id="impact-on-climate-change-mitigation">Impact on Climate Change Mitigation</h3>
<p>The plan’s market-based approach to addressing climate change, focusing on technological innovation rather than regulatory mandates, may not be sufficient to meet the urgent demands of the climate crisis. Without strict emissions limits or carbon pricing mechanisms, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions might fall short. Effective climate change mitigation requires a combination of market-based solutions and robust regulatory frameworks to drive significant reductions in emissions.</p>

<h3 id="potential-conflicts-of-interest">Potential Conflicts of Interest</h3>
<p>Encouraging public-private partnerships without adequate oversight could lead to conflicts of interest where private sector profit motives overshadow public interest considerations. Strong safeguards and accountability measures are essential to ensure that environmental and public health priorities are not compromised for financial gain. Ensuring transparency and accountability in these partnerships is crucial for maintaining public trust.</p>

<h3 id="funding-and-support-for-rd">Funding and Support for R&amp;D</h3>
<p>The success of increased investment in research and development (R&amp;D) depends on sustained financial and political support. Budget constraints and shifting political priorities could undermine long-term R&amp;D efforts, slowing down progress in addressing environmental challenges. Consistent funding and bipartisan support are necessary to ensure that innovative solutions and technologies are developed and deployed effectively.</p>

<h3 id="enforcement-and-compliance-challenges">Enforcement and Compliance Challenges</h3>
<p>A more balanced approach to enforcement and compliance, relying on incentives and voluntary programs, may not be sufficient to ensure adherence to environmental standards. Some businesses may not voluntarily comply with regulations without the threat of punitive measures. Effective enforcement mechanisms are necessary to hold violators accountable and ensure consistent compliance with environmental laws.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The proposed reforms for the Environmental Protection Agency under Project 2025 aim to streamline the agency and reduce regulatory burdens to promote economic growth. However, these reforms raise significant concerns about environmental degradation, public health risks, inconsistent protections, and the effectiveness of climate change mitigation efforts. Ensuring robust oversight, maintaining stringent environmental standards, and balancing economic development with sustainability are crucial to safeguarding the environment and public health.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-down-the-concerns-environmental-protection-agency">Breaking Down the Concerns: Environmental Protection Agency</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Environmental Degradation:</strong> Reducing regulations could lead to more pollution and harm to nature. This means dirtier air and water, and destruction of wildlife habitats, which can harm animals and plants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Public Health Risks:</strong> With fewer rules to control pollution, there could be more health problems like asthma, water contamination, and other diseases, especially for kids, elderly people, and those already sick.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inconsistent Environmental Protections:</strong> Giving more control to states could lead to uneven protections. Some states might have weaker rules, causing more pollution in certain areas, which can spread to neighboring states.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reduced Federal Oversight:</strong> Less federal control means states might not enforce environmental laws properly. Some states may lack resources or be less strict, leading to more environmental issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Impact on Climate Change Mitigation:</strong> Relying only on new technology and not strict rules may not be enough to fight climate change. Without strong regulations to cut emissions, efforts to reduce greenhouse gases might fail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Potential Conflicts of Interest:</strong> Partnering with private companies without strict oversight could prioritize profits over public health and the environment. It’s important to ensure these partnerships don’t compromise safety and health standards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Funding and Support for R&amp;D:</strong> New environmental technologies need consistent funding. If the government cuts budgets or changes priorities, important research could stop, slowing down solutions for environmental problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enforcement and Compliance Challenges:</strong> Relying on voluntary compliance and incentives might not work well. Some companies might ignore the rules if they don’t fear penalties, leading to more violations and environmental harm.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="red-flags-in-the-reforms-analyzing-troubling-quotes"><span id="redflags">Red Flags in the Reforms: Analyzing Troubling Quotes</span></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em><strong>Quote:</strong> “A conservative U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will take a more supportive role toward local and state efforts, building them up so that they may lead in a meaningful fashion” (Project 2025, 2024, p. 396).</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Summarize Quote:</strong> The EPA should support state and local efforts rather than leading initiatives itself.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This statement advocates for a decentralized approach to environmental regulation, placing more responsibility on state and local governments. While local authorities may have a better understanding of specific regional issues, this approach can lead to inconsistent enforcement and standards across the country. States with fewer resources or political will may underregulate, potentially leading to environmental degradation. The reduction of federal oversight could result in weaker protections for public health and the environment, particularly in areas where local governments may prioritize economic development over environmental concerns.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Quote:</strong> “True transparency will be a defining characteristic of a conservative EPA. This will be reflected in all agency work, including the establishment of open-source science, to build not only transparency and awareness among the public, but also trust” (Project 2025, 2024, p. 396).</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Summarize Quote:</strong> The EPA aims to promote transparency and trust by using open-source science.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While transparency and open-source science are commendable goals, the emphasis on these aspects may be a way to challenge and potentially undermine established scientific consensus, especially on controversial topics like climate change. By promoting “open-source” science, there is a risk of opening the door to non-expert opinions and less rigorous studies being given equal weight as peer-reviewed research. This could confuse the public and policymakers, hinder effective regulation, and delay necessary environmental protections.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Quote:</strong> “The EPA needs to be realigned away from attempts to make it an all-powerful energy and land use policymaker and returned to its congressionally sanctioned role as environmental regulator” (Project 2025, 2024, p. 396).</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Summarize Quote:</strong> The EPA should focus solely on environmental regulation, not on broader energy and land-use policy.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This statement suggests a narrowing of the EPA’s scope, potentially limiting its ability to address comprehensive environmental issues that intersect with energy and land use. The separation of these areas can overlook the interconnectedness of environmental protection with energy policy and land management. For example, regulating emissions from energy production is crucial for air quality and climate change mitigation. By restricting the EPA’s role, this approach may hinder efforts to tackle these broader challenges effectively and comprehensively.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Quote:</strong> “This approach is most obvious in the Biden Administration’s assault on the energy sector as the Administration uses its regulatory might to make coal, oil, and natural gas operations very expensive and increasingly inaccessible while forcing the economy to build out and rely on unreliable renewables” (Project 2025, p 396).</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Summarize Quote:</strong> The quote criticizes the Biden Administration for allegedly targeting the fossil fuel industry with regulations, favoring renewable energy sources.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The characterization of renewable energy as “unreliable” reflects a dismissive attitude towards a critical component of modern energy policy aimed at reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change. The description of regulatory actions as an “assault” suggests an adversarial stance towards necessary environmental regulations, potentially undermining efforts to transition towards cleaner energy sources. This framing could influence policy decisions that favor continued reliance on fossil fuels, thereby delaying or obstructing progress towards sustainable energy solutions. Such a position risks exacerbating environmental degradation and public health issues associated with fossil fuel extraction and consumption.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Quote:</strong> “The EPA has been a breeding ground for expansion of the federal government’s influence and control across the economy” (Project 2025, 2024, p. 397).</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Summarize Quote:</strong> The EPA is accused of expanding federal control over the economy.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Characterizing the EPA as expanding federal control reflects a broader critique of regulatory oversight as government overreach. This perspective often underestimates the necessity of regulations to protect public health and the environment. Regulations set by the EPA are typically based on scientific evidence and aim to mitigate environmental harm, which can have significant economic and social benefits in the long term. The focus on reducing federal influence may lead to deregulation, potentially compromising environmental standards and protections.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Quote:</strong> “An EPA led by activism and a disregard for the law has generated uncertainty in the regulated community, vendetta-driven enforcement, weighted analytics, increased costs, and diminished trust in final agency actions” (Project 2025, 2024, p. 397).</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Summarize Quote:</strong> The EPA is accused of being influenced by activism and ignoring laws, leading to uncertainty and distrust.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This statement criticizes the EPA’s enforcement and decision-making processes, suggesting they are influenced by political activism rather than legal mandates. The accusation of “vendetta-driven enforcement” implies that the agency unfairly targets certain industries, which could lead to perceptions of bias and undermine the EPA’s credibility. However, such criticisms may also reflect resistance to regulatory actions that are necessary for protecting the environment and public health. If these claims lead to weakened enforcement, it could result in less stringent regulation and oversight, potentially increasing environmental and public health risks.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><strong>Quote:</strong> “EPA should foster cooperative relationships with the regulated community, especially small businesses, that encourage compliance over enforcement” (Project 2025, 2024, p. 399).</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Summarize Quote:</strong> The EPA should prioritize helping businesses comply with regulations rather than strictly enforcing them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While fostering cooperation with businesses can lead to more voluntary compliance and a collaborative approach to regulation, it also risks reducing the stringency and consistency of enforcement. A focus on compliance over enforcement may allow some businesses to evade full accountability for environmental violations, particularly if penalties for non-compliance are weak or infrequent. This approach could undermine the effectiveness of regulations designed to protect public health and the environment, potentially leading to increased pollution and associated health risks.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency subsection of Project 2025 outlines a vision for a more conservative and decentralized approach to environmental regulation. It emphasizes reducing the federal government’s role, increasing transparency, and fostering cooperative relationships with regulated entities. However, these proposals raise concerns about potential deregulatory actions, reduced enforcement, and inconsistent environmental protections across different states. The critique of the EPA’s previous actions as overreaching and influenced by activism may lead to a rollback of essential regulations.</p>

<p>The potential implications of the immunity ruling could further exacerbate these issues by providing legal protection for implementing these policies without accountability. This lack of oversight could result in weakened regulations, reduced enforcement, and increased environmental risks. The overall impact could include less stringent environmental protections, greater variability in regulation across states, and potentially increased harm to public health and the environment. The emphasis on reducing federal influence and prioritizing economic considerations over environmental protection could hinder the country’s ability to address critical environmental challenges, such as climate change and pollution.</p>

<h2 id="environmental-protection-agency-in-a-nutshell"><span id="nutshell">“Environmental Protection Agency” in a Nutshell</span></h2>

<p>The section on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) within Project 2025 outlines a conservative restructuring of the agency, emphasizing a reduction in federal oversight and a shift toward state and local control over environmental regulations. The proposals advocate for the EPA to take a supportive role, providing resources and expertise to state governments while scaling back its own regulatory activities. The overarching goal is to reduce the EPA’s influence, streamline its operations, and align its activities with conservative principles, particularly cooperative federalism.</p>

<h3 id="key-proposals-and-concerns">Key Proposals and Concerns:</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Cooperative Federalism and State Leadership:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The plan emphasizes transferring more regulatory authority to state and local governments, allowing them to set environmental standards that align with their specific needs. This approach is rooted in the belief that local authorities are better positioned to understand and manage environmental issues within their jurisdictions.</li>
      <li><strong>Concern:</strong> While this may foster local innovation, it risks creating a patchwork of environmental standards across the country, with some states potentially adopting weaker regulations that could lead to environmental degradation. The lack of a unified federal standard may undermine nationwide efforts to combat pollution and protect public health.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Streamlining and Reducing EPA’s Role:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The proposal calls for a significant reduction in the EPA’s size and scope, including the elimination of what are viewed as duplicative or non-essential programs. This includes the dismantling of offices such as the Office of Environmental Justice and the Office of Public Engagement.</li>
      <li><strong>Concern:</strong> Reducing the EPA’s capacity to enforce environmental regulations could lead to less oversight of industries and more pollution, particularly in areas with less stringent state regulations. The elimination of the Office of Environmental Justice, in particular, raises concerns about the agency’s ability to address environmental inequities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Focus on Practical and Cost-Effective Solutions:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The EPA’s efforts should be directed toward solving tangible environmental problems with practical, cost-effective solutions. The plan criticizes what it perceives as the current administration’s focus on overly ambitious and politically driven environmental goals, particularly in the areas of climate change and renewable energy.</li>
      <li><strong>Concern:</strong> This focus on cost-effectiveness may prioritize short-term economic gains over long-term environmental sustainability. By downplaying the importance of addressing climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the plan risks undermining efforts to combat global warming and its associated impacts on public health and ecosystems.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Transparency and Open-Source Science:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The plan advocates for increased transparency in the EPA’s scientific processes, including the use of open-source science to build public trust. This would involve making all scientific studies and analyses that inform regulatory decisions publicly available for review and comment.</li>
      <li><strong>Concern:</strong> While transparency is generally positive, the emphasis on open-source science could be used to challenge established scientific consensus, particularly on contentious issues like climate change. This could lead to the inclusion of non-expert opinions in the regulatory process, potentially weakening the scientific basis for environmental regulations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Day One Executive Order and Immediate Reforms:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The proposal includes a “Day One” executive order for the incoming administration to pause and review all existing EPA regulations and grant programs. This would involve reassessing the agency’s structure, downsizing its workforce, and cutting its budget.</li>
      <li><strong>Concern:</strong> A sweeping review and rollback of existing regulations could create significant uncertainty for businesses and communities, disrupt ongoing environmental protection efforts, and result in weaker environmental standards. The emphasis on rapid changes may lead to hasty decisions that overlook the long-term consequences for the environment and public health.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Impact on Environmental Justice and Vulnerable Communities:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The plan calls for the elimination of the Office of Environmental Justice, arguing that its functions can be absorbed into other parts of the EPA. It also suggests that environmental justice initiatives should be based on “neutral constitutional principles.”</li>
      <li><strong>Concern:</strong> This move could dilute the focus on environmental justice, making it harder for vulnerable communities to receive the attention and resources they need to address environmental hazards. The removal of a dedicated office may reduce the effectiveness of efforts to tackle environmental inequities, leaving marginalized groups at greater risk.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="overall-implications">Overall Implications:</h3>

<p>The restructuring of the EPA as outlined in Project 2025 reflects a broader conservative agenda to reduce federal government intervention in environmental regulation and shift more responsibility to state and local governments. While the plan emphasizes principles like cooperative federalism and transparency, it raises significant concerns about the potential weakening of environmental protections, the erosion of public health safeguards, and the exacerbation of environmental injustices. The proposed budget cuts and downsizing could impair the EPA’s ability to effectively enforce environmental laws, respond to emergencies, and carry out its mission to protect the environment and public health. The focus on immediate reforms and cost-cutting measures may prioritize short-term economic interests over long-term environmental sustainability and public welfare.</p>
