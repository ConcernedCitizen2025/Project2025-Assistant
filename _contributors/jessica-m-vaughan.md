**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Director of Policy Studies, Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)

**Background:**  
Jessica M. Vaughan is the Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a position she has held since 1992. In her role, Vaughan focuses on immigration policy and its impacts on public safety, visa programs, and immigration enforcement. Before joining CIS, Vaughan was a Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. Department of State, where she served in Belgium and Trinidad & Tobago.

Vaughan is a frequent speaker at law enforcement and academic conferences, and she has testified before Congress on numerous occasions, providing expertise on immigration-related issues. Her writings have appeared in various major publications, and she is often cited in media outlets such as Fox News, CNN, and The Washington Post.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Vaughan and the Center for Immigration Studies were influential in shaping immigration policy during the Trump administration, particularly under the guidance of Trump advisor Stephen Miller. CIS’s research and recommendations were frequently cited to support the administration’s hardline stance on immigration, including policies like the travel ban and increased immigration enforcement.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Jessica Vaughan has been involved in several controversies due to her association with CIS, which has been labeled an "anti-immigrant hate group" by organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Vaughan's critics accuse her of promoting nativist and bigoted viewpoints, particularly through her outspoken opposition to sanctuary cities and her comments regarding immigration enforcement. These controversies have made her a polarizing figure in immigration policy debates.
