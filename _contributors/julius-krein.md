# Julius Krein

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Founder and Editor-in-Chief of American Affairs

**Background:**  
Julius Krein is a conservative political writer and editor best known for founding the journal American Affairs. He launched the journal in February 2017, aiming to provide intellectual support for the policies and ideas associated with the Trump administration. Krein has a background in finance, having worked for Bank of America and the Blackstone Group, and he also contributed to a pro-Trump blog during the 2016 presidential campaign.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Initially, American Affairs was perceived as a pro-Trump journal aiming to give intellectual heft to Trumpism. However, Krein's public disavowal of Trump in 2017, where he criticized the president's response to the Charlottesville rally, highlighted a significant departure from his earlier stance. Despite this, American Affairs continues to explore topics that resonate with both conservative and progressive critiques of contemporary politics.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
There are no major personal scandals associated with Julius Krein. The primary controversy stems from his shifting stance on Trump, moving from an ardent supporter to a vocal critic, which drew both support and criticism from different political factions.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Krein's early support for Trump and his attempt to provide a platform for Trumpism through American Affairs attracted significant attention. However, his subsequent public denunciation of Trump following the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally in August 2017 marked a dramatic shift. In an op-ed for The New York Times, Krein expressed regret for his support of Trump, citing disillusionment with Trump's presidency and the direction it was taking.
