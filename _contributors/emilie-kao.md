**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Senior Counsel and Vice President of Advocacy Strategy, Alliance Defending Freedom

**Background:**  
Emilie Kao is the Senior Counsel and Vice President of Advocacy Strategy at Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), where she leads efforts to promote religious freedom, free speech, and parental rights through legal and cultural initiatives. Before joining ADF, Kao directed the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation, focusing on policy work related to life, marriage, and religious freedom. She has an extensive background in defending religious liberties, having worked at the State Department's Office of International Religious Freedom and Becket Law. Kao holds degrees from Harvard University and Harvard Law School.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Kao’s work at ADF and previously at The Heritage Foundation aligns closely with the religious freedom policies promoted by the Trump administration. She has publicly supported Trump's initiatives to protect religious liberties, both domestically and internationally. Her advocacy work often mirrors the administration's emphasis on religious freedom as a cornerstone of its policy agenda, particularly in opposition to policies seen as restricting these freedoms.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
While Emilie Kao has not been involved in any personal scandals, her professional work has been part of broader controversies surrounding ADF's legal strategies. ADF’s positions on issues such as LGBTQ rights, religious freedom, and free speech have sparked significant public debate, often placing Kao in the center of contentious cultural and legal battles. Her strong stance on these issues has drawn both support from conservative groups and criticism from progressive and liberal organizations.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Kao's advocacy for conservative social policies, particularly regarding religious freedom and opposition to LGBTQ rights, has been polarizing. Her work is highly regarded within conservative circles but is frequently criticized by liberal groups that view ADF's positions as infringing on civil liberties. These controversies underscore the deeply divided public opinion on the issues she champions.
