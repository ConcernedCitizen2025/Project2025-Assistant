**Background:**  
Joe Trotter serves as the Director of the Energy, Environment, and Agriculture Task Force at the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). With over a decade of experience in policy, campaign management, and communications, Trotter has played a significant role in shaping energy and environmental policies from a free-market perspective. Before joining ALEC, he worked on Capitol Hill as a Natural Resources Legislative Assistant, where he collaborated with industries like coal, natural gas, logging, and transportation, alongside federal agencies, to address a variety of policy issues.

Trotter has also been a public spokesman for multiple free-market organizations and campaigns. His writings have appeared in publications such as *National Review*, *The Washington Examiner*, and *The Daily Caller*, reflecting his strong advocacy for deregulation and energy independence.

**Relation to Trump:**  
While Trotter’s work at ALEC is not directly tied to the Trump administration, his focus on reducing government regulation and promoting energy independence aligns closely with the Trump administration's priorities. ALEC’s policy recommendations during Trump’s tenure were consistent with the administration's efforts to roll back regulations and support fossil fuel industries.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
There are no significant scandals directly associated with Joe Trotter. However, ALEC itself has been the subject of controversy, particularly regarding its influence on state legislation and its stance on environmental issues, which often favors industry interests over environmental protections.
