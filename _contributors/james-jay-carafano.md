**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Vice President of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy and the E.W. Richardson Fellow at The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
James Jay Carafano is a leading expert in national security and foreign policy at The Heritage Foundation. He oversees the foundation's research on defense, intelligence, homeland security, and foreign policy issues. Carafano has a distinguished career that includes 25 years of service in the U.S. Army, where he retired as a lieutenant colonel. He holds a PhD from Georgetown University, an MA from the U.S. Army War College, and a BA from the United States Military Academy at West Point. At The Heritage Foundation, Carafano has played a significant role in shaping conservative policy perspectives, particularly in the areas of military strength and assertive foreign policy.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Carafano's policy positions and work at The Heritage Foundation align closely with many of the national security and foreign policy priorities of the Trump administration. He was an influential voice in promoting policies such as increased defense spending, a strong stance on border security, and a tough approach to international adversaries. Although Carafano did not hold an official position within the Trump administration, he was involved with Trump’s transition team and supported many of the administration's initiatives through his research and advocacy.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
James Jay Carafano has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, his strong support for certain national security policies and his role at The Heritage Foundation make him a prominent figure in debates over U.S. foreign and defense policy. His positions on issues such as immigration, military intervention, and international relations often attract both strong support and vigorous opposition.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Carafano’s strong advocacy for military strength and assertive foreign policy can be polarizing. Critics argue that such positions may contribute to international tensions and conflict, as they often emphasize military solutions over diplomatic efforts. Additionally, his work at The Heritage Foundation places him at the center of conservative policy advocacy, which can be contentious in broader public policy debates.
