**Background:**  
Clare Morell is a Senior Policy Analyst at the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), where she directs the Technology and Human Flourishing Project. Morell’s work focuses on the intersection of technology and policy, particularly concerning the impact of Big Tech on society. Before joining EPPC, she held significant roles in the Trump administration, including serving in the White House Counsel’s Office and as an Advisor to Attorney General Bill Barr at the Department of Justice. In these roles, she contributed to major initiatives, including the President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice and efforts to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides immunity to online platforms from certain types of legal liability.

She is an advocate for policies that protect children from the potential harms of social media and other online platforms.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Clare Morell’s career is closely tied to the Trump administration, where she played a key role in the Department of Justice under Attorney General Bill Barr. Her work on issues like Section 230 reform reflects a direct alignment with the Trump administration's efforts to regulate Big Tech and address concerns about online censorship and the power of large technology companies.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
There are no major personal scandals associated with Clare Morell. However, her involvement in advocating for more stringent regulations on Big Tech has placed her in the middle of a highly contentious debate. Critics of these efforts often argue that such regulations could stifle free speech, while proponents see them as necessary to curb the outsized influence of technology companies.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Morell's focus on regulating Big Tech, especially in terms of protecting children online, has raised concerns among free speech advocates who argue that such measures might lead to overreach and unintended consequences. However, her work is also seen as vital in addressing the negative impacts of technology on younger generations.
