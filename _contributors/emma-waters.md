Emma Waters is a Senior Research Associate at the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Life, Religion, and Family at The Heritage Foundation. Her work primarily focuses on issues related to family, bioethics, reproductive technology, and gender.

Waters' work at The Heritage Foundation, particularly through her contributions to Project 2025, aligns with the broader conservative agenda championed during the Trump administration. Her writings and policy recommendations reflect an ongoing commitment to advancing conservative principles in areas of family policy, reproductive rights, and religious liberty, which were key aspects of Trump's policy initiatives.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Emma Waters has been involved in several controversies, particularly regarding her outspoken critiques of surrogacy and LGBTQ-related policies. Her articles and public statements often criticize the commercialization of surrogacy and its implications for both women and children. Waters has also been a critic of the LGBTQ movement's influence on reproductive technologies, which has led to significant backlash from progressive groups.
