# Rachel Greszler

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Research Fellow at The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Rachel Greszler is a Senior Research Fellow in Economics, Budget, and Entitlements at The Heritage Foundation. Her work primarily focuses on labor policy, Social Security, disability insurance, pensions, and workforce issues. Before joining Heritage in 2013, she served as a Senior Economist at the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Greszler holds dual master's degrees in Economics and Public Policy from Georgetown University and a BA in Economics from the University of Mary Washington.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Rachel Greszler’s research and advocacy align with many of the economic principles promoted during the Trump administration, particularly concerning tax cuts, deregulation, and conservative approaches to Social Security and labor policies. Although she did not hold a formal position in the administration, her work at The Heritage Foundation supports the broader economic and fiscal policies that were central to Trump’s agenda.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Rachel Greszler has not been involved in any major personal scandals. Her policy positions, particularly her strong advocacy for conservative economic principles, often generate debate and can be polarizing, especially among those who support more progressive economic policies.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Greszler's advocacy for reducing government spending and promoting conservative economic reforms may be seen as favoring businesses and higher-income individuals while potentially neglecting the needs of lower-income workers. Her positions on Social Security and labor policies are often contentious, especially in discussions about economic inequality and public welfare programs.
