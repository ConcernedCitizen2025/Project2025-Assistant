# Leslie Ford

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Former Visiting Fellow in Domestic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Leslie Ford served as a Visiting Fellow in Domestic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, where she focused on welfare reform, poverty alleviation, and social services. Before joining Heritage, she held significant roles within the Trump administration, including serving as Domestic Policy Advisor and Special Assistant to the President from 2018 to 2020. In these capacities, Ford played a crucial role in developing the administration's welfare and anti-poverty strategic agenda. She also has experience working as a Legislative Advisor to Senator Mike Lee, where she contributed to major health and welfare reforms. Ford started her career at The Heritage Foundation as a Research Assistant, specializing in religious liberty, civil society, and poverty studies.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Leslie Ford’s work aligns closely with the Trump administration’s priorities, particularly in areas such as welfare reform and reducing government spending on social programs. During her time in the White House, she was instrumental in advancing policies that emphasized work requirements for welfare recipients and other conservative approaches to social safety nets, reflecting the administration’s broader agenda.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Leslie Ford has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, her work, particularly on welfare reform and social services, places her in the center of ongoing public debates about the role of government in addressing poverty and providing social safety nets. These discussions often generate significant scrutiny, especially from those who advocate for more expansive government intervention in social welfare.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Ford's advocacy for welfare reform, including work requirements and reductions in government intervention in social services, has been contentious. Critics argue that these policies may not sufficiently address the needs of vulnerable populations and could exacerbate poverty and inequality. Her work at The Heritage Foundation continues to be scrutinized, particularly by those who support a more robust social safety net.
