# Roman Jankowski

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Senior Investigative Counsel, Oversight Project

**Background:**  
Roman Jankowski is a Senior Investigative Counsel for the Oversight Project at The Heritage Foundation, where he focuses on exposing issues related to progressive policies of the Biden administration. He has over 13 years of experience with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), both in the private sector and across five federal agencies. Jankowski is also an investigative columnist for The Daily Signal, contributing commentary and analysis on various political and legal issues. His work primarily involves investigating and bringing to light what he perceives as overreach or mismanagement by the current administration.

**Relation to Trump:**  
While Roman Jankowski did not hold a formal position within the Trump administration, his work at The Heritage Foundation, particularly through the Oversight Project, aligns closely with conservative values that were prominent during Trump's presidency. His investigative efforts often target policies and actions that contrast with the Trump administration's agenda, reflecting a broader alignment with conservative principles.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Roman Jankowski has not been involved in any major personal scandals. His professional work, while often contentious and criticized by opponents, has not led to significant personal controversies. However, his role in high-profile investigations and his commentary on sensitive political issues frequently place him at the center of political debates, especially those related to the FBI's investigations and the Biden administration's policies.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Jankowski's investigative work frequently targets progressive policies, which can be polarizing. His focus on controversial issues, such as the FBI's handling of investigations and the Biden administration's immigration policies, attracts significant attention and criticism from supporters of these policies. His work can be seen as contributing to the broader partisan divide, particularly in the context of highly charged political environments.
