# Parker Stathatos

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Former Legislative Fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation

**Background:**  
Parker Stathatos has been affiliated with the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), where he served as a legislative fellow. He has experience as a legislative director during Texas' 87th Legislature, where he was involved in passing bills related to human trafficking, critical infrastructure, and blockchain technology. Prior to his time at TPPF, Stathatos participated in the White House Internship Program during the fall of 2020, specifically in the Office of the Senior Advisor for Policy. He holds a B.A. in government and history from the University of Texas at Austin.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Stathatos's connection to Trump is primarily through his participation in the White House Internship Program under Trump's administration. Additionally, TPPF, where Stathatos worked, is a contributor to Project 2025, a strategic initiative led by The Heritage Foundation aimed at preparing for a future conservative administration, potentially under Trump. Project 2025 is a coordinated effort to develop policy recommendations and build a coalition for implementing a conservative agenda in the next presidential term.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
There are no significant personal scandals or controversies directly associated with Parker Stathatos. However, the Texas Public Policy Foundation has been involved in various legal and political disputes, such as filing lawsuits to compel the U.S. Department of State to disclose documents related to the Biden administration's climate policies under the Paris Agreement.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Concerns may arise due to TPPF’s alignment with Project 2025, particularly regarding its influence on policies that may align with Trump’s administration's priorities. The foundation's involvement in climate litigation and conservative policy advocacy could be viewed as controversial, depending on the perspective of stakeholders.
