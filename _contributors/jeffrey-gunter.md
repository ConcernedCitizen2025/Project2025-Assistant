# Jeffrey Gunter

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Member of the Republican Jewish Coalition

**Background:**  
Jeffrey Gunter is a dermatologist and a prominent figure within the Republican Jewish Coalition, an organization that advocates for Jewish Republican values and policies. He served as the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland from 2019 to 2021 during the Trump administration. Gunter's background includes significant experience in healthcare administration and diplomacy. He holds a degree in medicine and has managed a dermatology practice with operations in California and Nevada. In addition to his diplomatic and medical career, Gunter has been an active donor and supporter of the Republican Party and has recently announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate from Nevada.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Jeffrey Gunter's service as U.S. Ambassador to Iceland under President Trump directly ties him to the Trump administration's foreign policy agenda. He has been a vocal supporter of Trump’s "America First" policies, both during his tenure as ambassador and in his current political activities, including his Senate campaign in Nevada. Gunter has portrayed himself as a staunch Trump ally, aligning his policy positions closely with those of the former president.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Gunter's tenure as Ambassador to Iceland was marked by several controversies. A report from the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General criticized his management style, describing the embassy environment under his leadership as "threatening and intimidating." Additionally, Gunter faced scrutiny for reportedly spending much of his time in California rather than in Iceland during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to concerns about his effectiveness in the role. These issues have resurfaced as he campaigns for the Senate, complicating his political aspirations.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Gunter’s diplomatic service and his involvement in Republican politics, particularly his strong alignment with Trump’s policies, can be contentious. Critics have raised concerns about his diplomatic decisions during his time as ambassador, including his management of the U.S. embassy in Iceland and his approach to U.S.-Iceland relations. His positions, which reflect the broader goals of the Republican Jewish Coalition, can be polarizing in the context of U.S. foreign and domestic policy.
