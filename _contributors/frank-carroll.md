**Relation to Trump:**  
Although Frank Carroll did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, the Becket Fund's work on religious liberty cases, such as defending the right of religious leaders to preach without government interference, aligns with the Trump administration's emphasis on religious freedom. Carroll's work at the Becket Fund, especially in cases like *Freedom From Religion Foundation v. Trump*, supports goals similar to those pursued by the Trump administration.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Frank Carroll has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, the Becket Fund’s legal positions often generate controversy, particularly in cases that balance religious liberty against other civil rights. The organization’s involvement in high-profile legal battles, such as those defending religious expressions in the public sphere, frequently leads to significant public and legal debate.

**Potential Concerns:**  
The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty often engages in litigation that can be highly controversial, particularly in cases where religious liberty claims conflict with other civil rights, such as LGBTQ rights and reproductive health. Critics argue that prioritizing religious liberty in certain contexts can undermine other fundamental rights, leading to significant public policy implications.
