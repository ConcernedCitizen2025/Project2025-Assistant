# Chuck DeVore

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Vice President of National Initiatives at the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF)

**Background:**  
Chuck DeVore serves as the Vice President of National Initiatives at the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), a prominent conservative think tank. DeVore has a distinguished background in public policy, military affairs, and media commentary. Before joining TPPF, he served as a California State Assemblyman, where he was known for his fiscal conservatism and advocacy for economic freedom. DeVore is a retired U.S. Army Reserve Lieutenant Colonel and has authored several books. He holds a BA from Claremont McKenna College and an MA in Strategic Studies from the U.S. Army War College.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Chuck DeVore’s policy positions and work at TPPF align closely with many of the economic and regulatory policies promoted by the Trump administration. His advocacy for deregulation, tax cuts, and conservative social policies mirrors the administration’s agenda. While DeVore did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, his work through TPPF, including participation in Project 2025, supports and amplifies similar policy goals aimed at shaping a future conservative administration.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Chuck DeVore has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his strong stance on conservative policies and his leadership role at TPPF place him at the center of ongoing policy debates, particularly those related to economic regulation, environmental policy, and public sector reform. These policy positions often generate significant public and political scrutiny.

**Potential Concerns:**  
DeVore's advocacy for conservative policies, including limited government, deregulation, and free-market principles, can be polarizing. Critics argue that such policies may disproportionately benefit businesses and the wealthy while neglecting the needs of lower-income individuals and public services. His positions on environmental regulation, taxation, and social policy frequently attract significant debate and opposition from progressive groups.
