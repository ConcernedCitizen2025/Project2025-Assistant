**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Senior Counselor and Director of Oversight and Investigations at America First Legal Foundation

**Background:**  
Reed Rubinstein is a prominent legal figure and conservative advocate, currently serving as Senior Counselor and Director of Oversight and Investigations at America First Legal Foundation. He has a notable career in legal and government roles, including his service as the Principal Deputy General Counsel at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) during the Trump administration. Rubinstein's work focuses on challenging federal regulations, advocating for limited government, and supporting conservative legal strategies.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Rubinstein's connection to Donald Trump is significant due to his role as the Principal Deputy General Counsel at the USDA during Trump’s administration, where he was deeply involved in shaping the administration's regulatory policies. His current position at America First Legal Foundation continues this alignment, reflecting ongoing support for Trump’s post-presidency efforts to influence legal and regulatory matters. This role involves advocating for and defending Trump-era policies while challenging the Biden administration's regulatory approaches.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Rubinstein has been involved in contentious legal battles over environmental regulations and land use, which attracted criticism from environmental advocates and other groups. His aggressive approach in legal challenges and regulatory issues has been a point of contention, though no major personal scandals are associated with him.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Rubinstein's role in defending Trump-era policies and his involvement in legal challenges against the current administration might be seen as polarizing. His strong conservative stance and involvement in high-profile legal battles could be viewed as controversial, especially by those who oppose Trump’s policies and approach to governance.
