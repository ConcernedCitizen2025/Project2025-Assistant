**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Director of the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget at The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Matthew Dickerson is a prominent expert on fiscal policy, currently serving as the Director of the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget at The Heritage Foundation. In this role, he oversees research and policy analysis focused on federal budget issues, including government spending, entitlement reform, and fiscal responsibility. Dickerson has a rich background in economic policy, having previously served as a Senior Policy Advisor on the House Budget Committee and as Policy Director for the Republican Study Committee. His work has also included positions at Americans for Prosperity and EPIC for America, where he continues to contribute to budget policy discussions. He holds a BA in Government and History from the College of William and Mary.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Matthew Dickerson’s work aligns closely with the fiscal policies promoted by the Trump administration, such as tax cuts, deregulation, and efforts to reduce federal spending. Although he did not hold a formal position within the Trump administration, his research and advocacy at The Heritage Foundation supported and complemented the administration's goals of promoting fiscal conservatism and economic growth through limited government intervention.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Matthew Dickerson has not been involved in any major personal scandals. His professional work at The Heritage Foundation and other conservative organizations has sometimes sparked public and political debate, particularly over proposals to reduce government spending and reform entitlement programs. However, there are no notable controversies directly linked to him personally.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Dickerson's advocacy for reduced government spending and fiscal responsibility can be contentious, especially when it involves cutting social services and welfare programs. Critics argue that such positions could disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. His alignment with The Heritage Foundation's conservative viewpoints further polarizes discussions about the role of government in economic management.
