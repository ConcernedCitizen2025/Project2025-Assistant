**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Distinguished Fellow Emeritus, The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Edwin Meese III is a prominent American attorney and public servant, best known for his role as the 75th Attorney General of the United States under President Ronald Reagan. Born on December 2, 1931, in Oakland, California, Meese has had a long and distinguished career in public service, beginning with his work in the Reagan administration at both the state and federal levels. He served as Reagan's Chief Policy Advisor and Counselor before becoming Attorney General, where he was instrumental in shaping policies on law enforcement, federalism, and constitutional law.

After leaving public office, Meese joined The Heritage Foundation as its first Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow, where he continues to influence conservative thought. He chaired the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Legal and Judicial Studies until 2013 and remains active as a Distinguished Fellow Emeritus. Meese has authored several books and continues to write and speak on issues related to the Constitution and public policy.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Edwin Meese’s connection to Donald Trump was highlighted in 2019 when Trump awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Meese, a staunch conservative and a key figure in the Reagan administration, supported Trump’s presidency and the continuation of Reagan's legacy through conservative policies. His longstanding influence in conservative circles helped shape the legal and policy frameworks during both the Reagan and Trump eras.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Meese's tenure as Attorney General was not without controversy. He was involved in the Wedtech scandal, a corruption investigation related to a New York defense contractor. While the investigation did not result in criminal charges, it concluded that Meese had violated ethical standards, leading to his resignation in 1988.
