**Potential Concerns:**  
Bhagat's academic work often emphasizes the importance of strong corporate governance and the role of financial oversight in preventing corporate malfeasance.

His work is significant in the ongoing debates over corporate governance, particularly in light of high-profile corporate failures and financial crises.
