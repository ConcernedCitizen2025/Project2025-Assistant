**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Executive Director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR)

**Background:**  
Julie Kirchner served as the Executive Director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) from 2005 to 2015. In this role, she managed the organization's operations, including policy development, government relations, and media engagement. She returned to FAIR in 2023 to resume her role as Executive Director. Kirchner has also worked at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, where she served as the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman and later as an advisor at U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Kirchner's involvement with FAIR aligns with the Trump administration's hardline stance on immigration. After leaving FAIR, she joined the Trump administration as an immigration advisor and later held significant roles at DHS, reflecting the administration's focus on stringent immigration policies. Her work at FAIR and subsequent roles in the Trump administration illustrate her alignment with the administration's immigration agenda.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
There are no major personal scandals associated with Julie Kirchner. However, her professional roles, particularly her leadership at FAIR, have placed her at the center of significant public and political debates regarding immigration policy. FAIR's association with controversial figures and its aggressive stance on immigration have attracted both support and criticism.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Kirchner's leadership at FAIR has been controversial due to the organization's stance on immigration, which includes advocating for strict immigration controls and reducing overall immigration levels. FAIR has been criticized by some groups, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, for promoting policies they view as anti-immigrant and for connections to figures with nativist views.
