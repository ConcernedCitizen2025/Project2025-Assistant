**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Former Commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

**Background:**  
Paul Atkins served as a Commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 2002 to 2008, where he was known for his strong advocacy of free-market principles and a deregulatory approach to financial regulation. After his tenure at the SEC, Atkins founded Patomak Global Partners, a financial services consulting firm that advises clients on regulatory compliance, risk management, and strategic issues. He has also served as an independent director and non-executive chairman of BATS Global Markets and was a member of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) from 2009 to 2010. Atkins holds a JD from Vanderbilt University Law School and a BA from Wofford College.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Paul Atkins played a significant role in the Trump administration as he was appointed to lead the financial regulatory transition team. His influence was evident in the administration's efforts to roll back certain Dodd-Frank Act provisions and implement a more business-friendly regulatory environment, reflecting his long-standing deregulatory philosophy.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
While Paul Atkins has not been involved in any major personal scandals, his deregulatory stance has been controversial. His tenure at the SEC and subsequent roles in the private sector have sparked debate over the balance between regulation and market freedom. Critics argue that his approach may prioritize corporate interests over consumer protections and market stability.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Atkins is known for advocating a deregulatory approach to financial regulation, which has raised concerns among those who support stricter oversight. His positions could be seen as weakening protections for investors and increasing systemic risk in the financial system. Additionally, his post-SEC career, particularly his consultancy work for financial firms, has been scrutinized for potential conflicts of interest.
