# Tom Dans

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Visiting Fellow, Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies, The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Tom Dans is currently a Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies, where he focuses on Ukraine's post-war reconstruction. He has a robust background in international finance, having worked at leading investment firms like Merrill Lynch, Evercore Partners, and Allen & Company, and later founding his own venture, Grand River Capital. Dans has invested in a wide range of industries, including oil and gas, media, and agribusiness. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dans left the private sector to join the U.S. Treasury as Counselor to the Under Secretary for International Affairs, where he played a critical role in the federal government's financial response to the pandemic, earning the Secretary’s Honor Award twice. He was later appointed by President Trump as a Commissioner of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, contributing to U.S. Arctic policy and advising both the President and Congress.

Dans graduated with honors from Brown University with a concentration in Slavic Studies and U.S. History and has completed a fellowship at Harvard University under its Advanced Leadership Initiative. He is a CFA Charterholder and fluent in five languages, reflecting his extensive international experience.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Tom Dans has deep ties to the Trump administration, having served as the Chief of Staff at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) during Trump's presidency. In this role, he managed the federal agency responsible for human resources policy for over two million federal employees. Dans was also involved with Project 2025, a conservative initiative aimed at preparing for a potential future Trump administration. His work at OPM, coupled with his leadership in Project 2025, highlights his significant role in shaping Trump-aligned strategies for federal governance.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
While Tom Dans has not been directly involved in major scandals, his aggressive approach in removing non-loyalists from government positions during his time at OPM has drawn scrutiny. This effort was part of a broader strategy to align federal agencies more closely with Trump's vision, which has been controversial among both critics and some former government officials.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Dans’ involvement in Project 2025 and his past efforts to reshape the federal bureaucracy according to conservative principles may raise concerns about the potential impacts of these policies on the functioning of government institutions. His background in high-stakes litigation and international finance, combined with his deep involvement in conservative political projects, positions him as a key figure in any future Trump administration, particularly in areas related to personnel management and policy implementation.
