**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Visiting Fellow, Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies, The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Tom Dans is an accomplished expert in international finance and investment, currently serving as a Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies. His career spans over 30 years, with significant experience in Eurasia and the Arctic. Dans has held senior positions at leading investment firms, including Merrill Lynch, Evercore Partners, and Allen & Company, and later founded his own venture, Grand River Capital. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dans left the private sector to serve as Counselor to the Under Secretary for International Affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In this role, he played a critical part in designing and executing the $78 billion CARES Act pandemic relief program for the aviation industry. For his work, he was awarded the Secretary’s Honor Award twice. In December 2020, President Trump appointed Dans as a Commissioner of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, where he contributed to shaping U.S. Arctic policy.

Dans holds a dual BA degree in Russian Studies and U.S. History from Brown University and completed an Advanced Leadership Fellowship at Harvard University. He is also a CFA Charterholder and is fluent in five languages, reflecting his extensive international experience.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Tom Dans was appointed by President Donald Trump as a Commissioner of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission in December 2020. His role at the Treasury Department during the Trump administration further solidifies his connection to Trump, particularly through his involvement in managing significant financial relief efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Tom Dans has not been involved in any major personal scandals. His work primarily revolves around finance, policy, and strategic advisory roles, which have not drawn significant public controversy.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Dans’ involvement in U.S. Arctic policy and his role during the financial response to the pandemic highlight his influence in areas that are critical to U.S. interests. His position at the Heritage Foundation and past government roles may prompt scrutiny regarding his influence on U.S. policy, particularly in the Arctic region and international finance.
