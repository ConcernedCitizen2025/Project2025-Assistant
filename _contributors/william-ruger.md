# William Ruger

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Vice President for Research and Policy, Charles Koch Institute

**Background:**  
William Ruger is a prominent figure in the fields of foreign policy and national security. He serves as the Vice President for Research and Policy at the Charles Koch Institute and is also affiliated with the American Institute for Economic Research. Ruger is known for his advocacy of restraint in U.S. foreign policy and his criticism of interventionist approaches. He was nominated by President Donald Trump to be the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, a position that reflected Trump’s interest in winding down U.S. military involvement in the region, although Ruger was never confirmed by the Senate.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Ruger’s connection to Trump is significant due to his nomination as U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, which aligned with Trump's policy of reducing American military presence abroad. Ruger’s views on foreign policy resonate with Trump’s “America First” approach, particularly in advocating for a more restrained U.S. role on the global stage. His work with organizations that emphasize economic freedom and limited government further aligns with the broader conservative agenda that was prominent during Trump’s presidency.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
There are no major scandals or controversies directly associated with William Ruger. His work is focused on policy research and advocacy, particularly in the areas of foreign policy and economic freedom, without significant public disputes.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Critics of Ruger’s foreign policy stance may argue that his advocacy for non-interventionism could lead to reduced U.S. influence globally, potentially emboldening adversaries. However, these concerns are generally more about policy disagreements than any personal controversy.
