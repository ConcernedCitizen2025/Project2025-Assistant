# Aaron Kheriaty

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Fellow and Director of the Program in Bioethics and American Democracy at the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC)

**Background:**  
Dr. Aaron Kheriaty is a psychiatrist and bioethicist currently serving as a Fellow and Director of the Program in Bioethics and American Democracy at the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC). He has authored three books, including *The New Abnormal: The Rise of the Biomedical Security State* (2022). Dr. Kheriaty previously held academic positions, including Professor of Psychiatry at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) School of Medicine, where he also directed the Medical Ethics Program. He holds a JD from the University of Florida Levin College of Law and a BA from Florida State University.

**Relation to Trump:**  
While Dr. Kheriaty did not hold an official position within the Trump administration, his views on medical ethics, particularly regarding public health mandates, align with the conservative positions that were prominent during Trump's presidency. His role at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank, aligns him with broader conservative values.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
- **COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate Opposition:** Dr. Kheriaty became widely known for his public opposition to COVID-19 vaccine mandates, arguing on ethical and medical grounds that individuals with natural immunity should not be required to get vaccinated. This stance led to his dismissal from UC Irvine in December 2021 after 14 years of service. His legal challenge against the university's mandate, which he argued violated constitutional rights under the 14th Amendment, was ultimately unsuccessful in the federal courts.
- **Ongoing Advocacy:** Despite the legal setback, Dr. Kheriaty remains a vocal critic of public health mandates, continuing to engage in public discussions and lawsuits aimed at challenging government policies related to COVID-19. His work has sparked significant debate, with supporters praising his stand for medical freedom and critics accusing him of undermining public health efforts.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Dr. Kheriatyâ€™s stance on COVID-19 policies, particularly vaccine mandates, has been polarizing. While he has garnered support for his advocacy for medical freedom, his views have also attracted significant criticism from public health experts who argue that his positions could potentially endanger public health by discouraging vaccination.
