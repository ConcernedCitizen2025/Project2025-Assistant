**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Research Associate at The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Amalia Halikias is a Research Associate at The Heritage Foundation, where she focuses on policy research and analysis in areas such as national security, economic policy, and social issues. Halikias has a background in political science and public policy, having worked in various capacities related to policy research and advocacy. She holds degrees from respected academic institutions.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Amalia Halikias's role at The Heritage Foundation involves areas of policy research that align with Donald Trump's agenda, particularly in economic and social policies. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a key initiative aimed at preparing for a potential future conservative administration, is closely aligned with the priorities that were central to the Trump administration. Halikias's involvement in Project 2025 further illustrates this connection, as the project has drawn attention for its ambitious goals of overhauling federal agencies and consolidating executive power.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Halikias has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, her professional work in policy research and advocacy, particularly her involvement in Project 2025, has attracted public and political scrutiny. The initiative's conservative agenda is polarizing and has been met with both support and opposition.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Halikias's advocacy for conservative values and policies can be contentious. Critics may argue that her positions on social and economic issues could marginalize progressive viewpoints and the needs of disadvantaged groups. Her work often involves challenging progressive policy frameworks, attracting significant opposition from those who advocate for more inclusive policies.
