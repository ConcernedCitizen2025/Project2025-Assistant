**Background:**  
Amalia Halikias is the Government Relations Director at The Heritage Foundation, where she is deeply involved in policy research and advocacy in areas such as national security, economic policy, and social issues. Her work plays a key role in shaping conservative policies, particularly through her involvement in Project 2025.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Amalia Halikias’s role at The Heritage Foundation involves significant work that aligns with Donald Trump’s agenda, particularly in economic and social policies. Project 2025, a key initiative of The Heritage Foundation aimed at preparing for a potential future conservative administration, is closely aligned with the priorities of the Trump administration. Halikias’s involvement in Project 2025 underscores her connection to Trump’s political movement, as the project aims to overhaul federal agencies and consolidate executive power. Additionally, her connection with J.D. Vance, a Trump ally, through Venmo adds a personal dimension to her ties within Trump-aligned circles.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Halikias has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, her professional work in policy research and advocacy, particularly her involvement in Project 2025, has attracted public and political scrutiny. The initiative’s ambitious conservative agenda has been met with both support and opposition, highlighting its polarizing nature.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Halikias’s advocacy for conservative values and policies can be contentious. Critics argue that her positions on social and economic issues could marginalize progressive viewpoints and the needs of disadvantaged groups. Her work often involves challenging progressive policy frameworks, attracting significant opposition from those who advocate for more inclusive policies.
