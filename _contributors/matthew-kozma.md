# Matthew Kozma

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Former Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the Intelligence Community, Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)

**Background:**  
Matthew Kozma served as the Chief Information Officer (CIO) for the Intelligence Community (IC) within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) from November 2020 until early 2021. In this role, Kozma was responsible for advising the Director of National Intelligence on information management, technology, and assurance. He oversaw IT infrastructure and investment priorities across the IC's 17 agencies. Kozma brought a wealth of experience to the position, having served as the executive agent for the Department of Defense’s Unified Platform and Joint Cyber Command and Control, where he focused on optimizing investments and closing critical cyberspace capability gaps. A U.S. Air Force veteran with 25 years of service, Kozma holds degrees in electrical engineering and applied physics from the U.S. Air Force Academy, and an MBA from American University. He has also completed advanced studies at MIT and Harvard.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Kozma was appointed as the IC CIO during the Trump administration, aligning his work with the administration's emphasis on strengthening national security through advanced IT and cybersecurity capabilities. His role was critical in modernizing the IT infrastructure across the intelligence community during a period of heightened focus on cybersecurity and digital threats.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Matthew Kozma has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his work within the sensitive and high-stakes environment of the IC's IT and cybersecurity infrastructure inevitably places him at the center of critical national security operations, which are often subject to scrutiny. His resignation in early 2021 marked the end of his tenure shortly after the transition to the Biden administration.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Kozma’s role in overseeing the modernization and cyber capabilities of the IC involves navigating complex ethical and operational challenges, especially regarding privacy, security, and the implications of AI and advanced technologies in national security.
