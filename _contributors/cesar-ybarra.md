**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Vice President of Policy, FreedomWorks

**Background:**  
Cesar Ybarra serves as the Vice President of Policy at FreedomWorks, where he is responsible for managing legislative affairs and guiding the organization's policy initiatives. Born in Mexico and later naturalized as a U.S. citizen, Ybarra has been deeply involved in conservative politics. He holds a B.A. in Political Science from Arizona State University and has previously worked as Campaign Manager and Legislative Director for Congressman Andy Biggs (R-AZ). His efforts at FreedomWorks focus on promoting small government, economic freedom, and engaging Hispanic communities in conservative advocacy.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Ybarra's policy work at FreedomWorks aligns with the key principles of the Trump administration, such as deregulation and economic nationalism. He has emphasized the importance of conservative policies, particularly those that were highlighted during Trump's presidency, in resonating with Hispanic voters—a demographic where Trump saw increased support in the 2020 election.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Cesar Ybarra himself has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, FreedomWorks, as an organization, has been at the forefront of several controversial political debates. Ybarra has been vocal in opposing certain bipartisan legislative efforts, reflecting the organization’s stance on limiting government intervention, which has garnered both support and criticism.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Ybarra's advocacy for reducing the size and scope of government has raised concerns among critics who argue that such policies might undermine essential public services and deepen social inequalities. His role in advancing a conservative agenda through grassroots organization and legislative efforts continues to be a significant point of discussion in U.S. politics.
