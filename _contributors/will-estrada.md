**Relation to Trump:**  
While Will Estrada did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, the Parental Rights Foundation's advocacy efforts align with broader conservative policy goals that were supported by the Trump administration.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Estrada's strong advocacy for parental rights and educational freedom can be contentious, especially in debates over public education, homeschooling regulations, and the role of government in child welfare. Critics may argue that prioritizing parental rights over regulatory oversight could potentially undermine protections for children, particularly in cases of neglect or abuse. Additionally, his positions on education and parental rights can be polarizing, attracting both strong support and significant opposition.
