**Background:**  
Troy Edgar is a Managing Director at IBM Consulting, where he focuses on helping clients navigate complex business challenges and implement innovative solutions. Before joining IBM, Edgar served as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the Trump administration, managing a $90 billion budget and overseeing financial operations for the department. His extensive experience includes roles in both the public and private sectors, such as President and CEO of Global Conductor, a consulting firm he founded, and as CFO for Boeing’s Military Transport Aircraft division. Edgar holds a BA from the University of Southern California and an MBA from Pepperdine University.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Troy Edgar’s role as CFO of DHS placed him directly within the Trump administration, where he played a key role in managing the financial operations of one of the largest federal departments. His work involved aligning the department’s financial strategies with the administration’s broader policies, particularly those focused on national security and operational efficiency.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Troy Edgar has not been involved in any major personal scandals. His tenure at DHS and his subsequent role at IBM Consulting have been characterized by a focus on financial management and operational efficiency. Although his work at DHS, a high-profile federal department, was subject to the usual levels of public and political scrutiny, there are no notable controversies directly linked to him personally.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Edgar’s transition from a significant government role to a leadership position in a major consulting firm like IBM could raise questions about the revolving door between the public and private sectors. In his role as CFO, he was responsible for significant budgetary and financial oversight, which can be subject to intense scrutiny regarding the management of taxpayer funds and the implementation of administration policies.
