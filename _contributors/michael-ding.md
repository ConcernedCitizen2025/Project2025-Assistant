**Position:** Legal Counsel at America First Legal Foundation

**Background:**  
Michael Ding serves as Legal Counsel at America First Legal Foundation, an organization founded by former Trump administration officials to promote conservative legal principles and challenge progressive policies through strategic litigation. Ding's responsibilities include providing legal advice, drafting legal documents, and representing the foundation in court cases that align with its mission to uphold conservative values. His work often involves high-profile legal battles that challenge actions taken by the Biden administration, particularly in areas such as election integrity, religious freedom, and federal overreach. Ding holds a JD from a respected law school and has gained considerable experience in litigation and legal analysis through his role at America First Legal.

**Relation to Trump:**  
America First Legal Foundation was established by former Trump administration officials, and its legal advocacy aligns closely with the policy goals of the Trump administration. Although Michael Ding did not hold a formal position within the Trump administration, his work at the foundation is directly connected to advancing the administration's conservative legal agenda, particularly in efforts to challenge and reverse progressive policies implemented by the Biden administration.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Michael Ding has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, the legal actions and advocacy work of America First Legal Foundation often generate significant public and political debate. The foundation's aggressive litigation strategy, particularly in areas like election law and government transparency, is both praised by conservative supporters and criticized by progressive groups, making Ding's work a focal point of ongoing legal and political controversies.

**Potential Concerns:**  
America First Legal's strong ties to former Trump administration officials and its focus on conservative legal advocacy can be contentious. Critics argue that the foundation's efforts to challenge progressive policies might undermine initiatives aimed at promoting social equity and justice. Ding's role in supporting these legal challenges places him at the center of these debates, with potential concerns about the broader implications of the foundation's legal strategies.
