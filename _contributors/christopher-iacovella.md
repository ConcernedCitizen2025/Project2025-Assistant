# Christopher Iacovella

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** President and CEO of the American Securities Association (ASA)

**Background:**  
Christopher A. Iacovella is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the American Securities Association (ASA). He previously served as CEO of the Equity Dealers of America, where he successfully expanded the association's influence among policymakers and regulators. Iacovella has a strong background in financial services, holding positions such as Senior Director of Global Government Affairs at Bloomberg and Special Counsel at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). His extensive experience in regulatory affairs and public policy has positioned him as a key figure in advocating for the financial services industry.

**Relation to Trump:**  
While Christopher Iacovella did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, his regulatory stances and leadership in conservative financial circles align closely with the deregulatory policies promoted during Trump's presidency. His work through the ASA and his critiques of regulatory overreach, particularly by the SEC, resonate with the Trump administration's broader economic and regulatory agenda, which emphasized reducing government interference in business.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Christopher Iacovella has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his professional work, especially his outspoken criticism of the SEC and other regulatory bodies, has been contentious within the financial sector. His advocacy for a less burdensome regulatory environment is supported by some as a way to promote economic growth, while others argue it could lead to insufficient oversight of the financial industry.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Iacovellaâ€™s critiques of regulatory policies, particularly his stance against what he perceives as SEC overreach, may raise concerns among those who believe stringent regulations are necessary to protect the economy and consumers. His leadership in conservative financial circles and alignment with deregulatory policies could attract scrutiny, especially in debates over the balance between economic growth and regulatory oversight.
