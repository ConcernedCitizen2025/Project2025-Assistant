# William Steiger

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Independent Consultant

**Background:**  
William Steiger is an experienced public health official and consultant, known for his work in both governmental and international health organizations. He served as the Director of the Office of Global Health Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) during the George W. Bush administration. Steiger has a deep background in health policy, particularly in the context of global health initiatives. His work has often involved collaborating with international bodies to advance U.S. health policy interests abroad.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Although Steiger’s primary government service was under George W. Bush, his continued involvement in conservative policy circles aligns him with initiatives supported by Trump’s administration. Steiger’s work, particularly in consulting on public health policy, may intersect with ongoing conservative efforts to shape future health policies, as evidenced by his mention in connection with Project 2025.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
William Steiger was previously involved in controversy during his tenure at HHS, particularly regarding accusations that his appointment was politically motivated, given his close ties to the Bush family despite lacking extensive health qualifications at the time. This led to criticism from various quarters within the public health community.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Critics might be concerned about Steiger's role in influencing health policies that align with conservative agendas, particularly if these policies prioritize political considerations over scientific expertise. However, his extensive experience in global health initiatives is also seen as an asset in certain conservative policy-making contexts.
