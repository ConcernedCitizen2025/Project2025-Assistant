Steven G. Bradbury’s role as General Counsel and Acting Deputy Secretary of Transportation placed him at the core of the Trump administration’s transportation policy and regulatory agenda. His work involved implementing and defending the administration’s policies on infrastructure, safety regulations, and innovation in transportation technology. His leadership at the DOT was integral to advancing the administration's goals in these areas.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Bradbury’s most notable controversies stem from his time at the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) during the George W.
