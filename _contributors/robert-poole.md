# Robert Poole

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Director of Transportation Policy, Reason Foundation

**Background:**  
Robert Poole is the Director of Transportation Policy at the Reason Foundation, where he has worked extensively on transportation policy, infrastructure financing, and privatization of public services. He is a recognized expert in public policy analysis, with a particular focus on advocating for market-based solutions to public sector challenges. Poole has advised several U.S. administrations on transportation and infrastructure issues, including roles in advisory capacities during the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations.

**Relation to Trump:**  
While Robert Poole’s direct involvement with the Trump administration is not well-documented, his policy advocacy aligns with the deregulatory and privatization agendas that were significant components of Trump's economic policy. The Reason Foundation, where Poole works, has been involved in supporting initiatives that resonate with the principles of economic freedom and limited government, both of which were championed during Trump’s presidency.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
There are no major scandals or controversies directly associated with Robert Poole. His work has generally focused on public policy and infrastructure, areas typically less prone to personal scandal but subject to policy debate.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Critics of Poole’s advocacy for privatization argue that such policies can undermine public accountability and lead to unequal access to essential services. However, these concerns are more related to the broader policy implications of privatization rather than specific controversies involving Poole himself.
