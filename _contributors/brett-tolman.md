# Brett Tolman

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Former U.S. Attorney, Legal Adviser

**Background:**  
Brett Tolman is a former U.S. Attorney for the District of Utah and a significant figure in legal reform circles. He played a crucial role in criminal justice reform efforts during the Trump administration, notably contributing to the development of the First Step Act, a bipartisan effort to reduce recidivism and reform sentencing laws. Tolman is also known for his legal analysis and advocacy, frequently appearing in media to discuss legal issues and policy reform.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Tolman has close ties to the Trump administration, having been one of the architects behind the First Step Act, a key piece of legislation supported by Trump. He has also been involved in legal efforts to support Trump and his allies, including facilitating a pardon for Charles Kushner, Jared Kushner’s father. Tolman’s involvement in Project 2025 further cements his role in shaping the legal framework and policies that could define a potential second Trump term.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Brett Tolman has not been personally involved in scandals, but his role in advocating for pardons for Trump allies and his involvement in legal strategies connected to Trump’s controversial policies have attracted criticism. His participation in Project 2025, a highly polarizing initiative, aligns him with efforts that some view as undermining democratic institutions and increasing executive power.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Tolman’s involvement in Project 2025 and his history with the Trump administration raise concerns about the direction of legal reforms and the potential for increased politicization of the justice system. Critics worry that his work could lead to further erosion of checks and balances within the government, especially if Project 2025’s more extreme proposals are implemented.
