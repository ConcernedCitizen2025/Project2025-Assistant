**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at the Independent Women's Forum (IWF), Senior Policy Analyst at Independent Women's Voice

**Background:**  
Gabriella Hoffman is a prominent figure at the Independent Women's Forum (IWF), where she directs the Center for Energy and Conservation. In this role, she advocates for energy independence, land conservation, and educates the public on the benefits of modern energy solutions. Hoffman is also a freelance media strategist, an award-winning writer, and a political columnist for Townhall.com. She hosts the "District of Conservation" podcast and the "Conservation Nation" video series. Her writings have appeared in numerous publications, including the Washington Examiner, The Hill, RealClearPolicy, and the Wall Street Journal. Additionally, Hoffman is active in the conservation community and has been recognized for her work on various environmental issues.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Although Gabriella Hoffman did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, her work at IWF aligns with conservative principles that were prominent during Trump's presidency. For example, her focus on energy security, skepticism towards strict environmental regulations, and advocacy for deregulation resonate with the policies supported by the Trump administration. Her colleague, Mandy Gunasekara, who previously directed IWF's Center for Energy and Conservation, was actively involved in the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accords during Trump's tenure, further tying the work of IWF to Trump-era policies.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Gabriella Hoffman has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, her professional work, particularly her advocacy for conservative energy policies, can be polarizing. Her positions on energy security and environmental regulations have sparked debate, especially among those who favor more stringent environmental protections.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Hoffmanâ€™s association with IWF, a conservative organization, and her advocacy for energy policies that prioritize security and deregulation over environmental regulations may attract criticism from environmental advocates and those with differing political views. Her stance on issues like the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) movement also positions her in a contentious area of public discourse.
