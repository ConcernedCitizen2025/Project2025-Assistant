# Richard Hanania

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** President of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology (CSPI)

**Background:**  
Richard Hanania is the President of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology (CSPI), an organization dedicated to researching and analyzing partisanship, ideology, and their effects on society. Hanania holds a PhD in political science from UCLA and a JD from the University of Chicago Law School. He is known for his research and writings on public policy, political polarization, and international relations.

**Relation to Trump:**  
While there is no direct connection between Richard Hanania and Donald Trump, his work on political polarization and ideology intersects with discussions about the Trump era's influence on American politics. His ideas often resonate with broader conservative movements that gained prominence during and after Trump’s presidency.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
In 2023, it was revealed that Hanania previously wrote for white nationalist and far-right websites under the pseudonym "Richard Hoste." His writings during that period supported eugenics, racial segregation, and white nationalism, which have drawn significant criticism. Although Hanania has partially renounced these views, controversies remain about the extent to which his current perspectives have evolved. Despite these revelations, Hanania continues to be active in public discourse, including appearances on platforms associated with far-right figures.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Given his controversial past and the nature of his writings, Hanania’s involvement in political and ideological discussions could polarize audiences and lead to further scrutiny. His association with far-right ideologies, even if partially disavowed, poses significant reputational risks and could undermine the credibility of his current work and the organizations he is affiliated with.
