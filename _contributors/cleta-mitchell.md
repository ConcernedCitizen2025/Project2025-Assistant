**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Senior Legal Fellow, Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI)

**Background:**  
Cleta Mitchell is a prominent conservative attorney specializing in election law, campaign finance, and political advocacy. She is currently the Senior Legal Fellow at the Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI) and the founder of the Election Integrity Network. Mitchell has had a long career in conservative legal circles and has been involved in numerous high-profile legal battles, including representing Donald Trump in his 2020 election legal challenges in Georgia. Previously, she served as a trustee for the legal defense fund of former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and represented Stephen Bannon's nonprofit organization.

Mitchell began her career as a Democratic member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives before switching to the Republican Party, where she became an influential legal advisor.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Mitchell is closely associated with Donald Trump, particularly for her involvement in efforts to contest the 2020 presidential election results. She participated in the January 2, 2021, phone call where Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state's election results. This led to her resignation from the law firm Foley & Lardner due to the firm's concerns about her involvement in these efforts.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Mitchell has been involved in several controversies, including her vocal opposition to IRS scrutiny of Tea Party groups, which she claimed were unfairly targeted. Her role in Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election has drawn significant public and legal scrutiny. Additionally, her advocacy for restrictive voting laws has been criticized for potentially disenfranchising voters.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Mitchell's work on voter fraud and election integrity, including her leadership in organizing efforts to challenge voter eligibility, has raised concerns about the potential impact on voter access and the integrity of future elections. Her initiatives have been supported by well-funded conservative groups, such as the Ziklag Fund, which has helped finance her efforts to reshape the electoral process in favor of conservative candidates.
