**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Former Senior Deputy General Counsel at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

**Background:**  
Erik Baptist served as the Senior Deputy General Counsel at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the Trump administration. In this role, he was involved in significant regulatory changes, particularly in the rollback of environmental protections. Prior to joining the EPA, Baptist worked as a senior attorney at the American Petroleum Institute (API), where he focused on energy and environmental law. He holds a JD from George Mason University School of Law and a BA from the University of Virginia.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Baptist's appointment to the EPA aligns with the Trump administration's efforts to deregulate the energy sector and reduce the regulatory burden on industries. His work at the EPA was directly tied to the administration's broader agenda of promoting energy independence and economic growth, often prioritizing industry interests over environmental safeguards.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
While Erik Baptist has not been involved in any personal scandals, his tenure at the EPA was marked by significant controversies. His role in rolling back key environmental regulations, such as those related to air pollution and methane emissions, drew heavy criticism from environmental groups. These rollbacks were seen as undermining efforts to combat climate change and protect public health, leading to legal challenges and public outcry from environmental advocates.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Baptist's background in the oil and gas industry and his role in deregulating environmental protections raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics argue that his work may have favored industry interests at the expense of environmental sustainability, reflecting the broader criticisms of the Trump administration's environmental policies.
