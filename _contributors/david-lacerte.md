**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Special Counsel at Baker Botts LLP

**Background:**  
David LaCerte is a seasoned lawyer with a robust background in public policy and executive roles within state and federal government agencies. Currently, he serves as Special Counsel at Baker Botts LLP, where he specializes in energy litigation, environmental safety, and incident response. Throughout his career, LaCerte has held various high-level positions, including Senior Advisor and Executive Counsel to the U.S. Chemical Safety Board and Deputy Associate Director at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management during the Trump administration. He is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, having served in Afghanistan and Pakistan, leading over 100 combat patrols and missions.

**Relation to Trump:**  
David LaCerte served as a Senior Advisor at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management under the Trump administration, where he was involved in shaping federal executive service policies and providing special counsel on regulatory matters. His role aligned with the administration's focus on regulatory reform and improving government efficiency.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
LaCerte’s tenure as Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs (LDVA) was marred by controversy. In 2015, he resigned amid investigations by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor and the Office of State Inspector General. The investigations uncovered issues such as improper use of funds, questionable hiring practices, and a failure to report crimes involving veterans under the LDVA's care. These findings led to significant public scrutiny, although LaCerte has vehemently denied the allegations, calling the reports "garbage" and pursuing defamation lawsuits against the state and its officials.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Given his controversial tenure at the LDVA, LaCerte's role in managing regulatory and policy matters might attract scrutiny, particularly from those concerned with transparency and accountability in public administration. His involvement in significant legal disputes related to his previous roles could raise concerns about his approach to governance and oversight.
