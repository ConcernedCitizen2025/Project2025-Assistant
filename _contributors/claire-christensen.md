# Claire Christensen

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Director of Research and Chinese Studies at Gingrich 360

**Background:**  
Claire Christensen is a leading expert in U.S.-China relations, national security, and foreign policy. As the Director of Research and Chinese Studies at Gingrich 360, she oversees in-depth research and policy analysis on critical issues affecting U.S.-China relations. Christensen co-authored the New York Times Best Seller “Trump versus China: Facing America’s Greatest Threat,” which highlights the strategic challenges posed by China to the United States. Her editorials have appeared in prominent media outlets, including Fox News, Newsweek, and The Hill. In addition, she has been a guest on Newt Gingrich’s podcast, *Newt’s World*, and has spoken at Arizona State University on topics related to her expertise. Christensen graduated from the University of Texas at Austin and is currently pursuing a master’s degree at Hillsdale College. She is a Fellow at the American Cornerstone Institute and an alumna of the Bill Archer Fellowship Program.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Claire Christensen has substantial ties to Donald Trump through her professional endeavors and affiliations. Her co-authorship of "Trump versus China" aligns directly with Trump's policies on confronting China's influence, making her a key figure in the discourse surrounding U.S.-China relations within the Trump-aligned conservative movement. At Gingrich 360, she works closely with Newt Gingrich, a staunch Trump supporter, further entrenching her in Trump’s political network. Additionally, her fellowship at the American Cornerstone Institute, an organization founded by Ben Carson—Trump’s former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development—strengthens her connection to Trump's inner circle. Christensen is also a contributor to Project 2025, a conservative initiative designed to prepare for a potential Trump or Trump-aligned administration in 2025, highlighting her role in shaping future conservative policies.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
To date, Claire Christensen has not been implicated in any personal scandals. However, her association with Trump-aligned organizations and her role in shaping U.S. policy towards China may subject her to criticism, particularly from those opposed to Trump’s foreign policy strategies. Her involvement in Project 2025, a highly ambitious conservative effort, may also attract scrutiny given its potential impact on the future direction of U.S. governance.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Christensen’s influence in U.S.-China policy, coupled with her active role in Project 2025, raises potential concerns about the direction of U.S. foreign policy under a future Trump or Trump-aligned administration. Critics might argue that her hardline stance on China could contribute to escalating tensions between the two superpowers, with significant implications for global stability. Furthermore, her involvement in Project 2025 suggests she could play a pivotal role in implementing policies that align closely with Trump’s agenda, which may be contentious depending on the broader political landscape.
