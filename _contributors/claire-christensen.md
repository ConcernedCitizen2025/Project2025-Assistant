# Claire Christensen

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Research Associate at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI)

**Background:**  
Claire Christensen is a Research Associate at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a prominent conservative think tank focused on public policy research. In her role, she contributes to research and analysis on various policy issues, including education, social policy, and economic policy. Christensen holds a BA from Brigham Young University and has experience in policy research and analysis, supporting the work of senior scholars at AEI.

**Relation to Trump:**  
While Claire Christensen did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, her work at AEI aligns with many of the policy positions promoted by the Trump administration, particularly in areas such as deregulation, economic policy, and education reform. AEI's influence on conservative policy-making during Trump's presidency highlights the ideological alignment between her research contributions and the administration's goals.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Claire Christensen has not been involved in any major personal scandals. Her work at AEI, a well-respected think tank, is part of the institution's broader efforts to influence public policy through research and analysis. While AEI’s positions can be controversial, particularly among those who disagree with its conservative stance, there are no notable controversies directly associated with Christensen herself.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Christensen’s work at AEI involves contributing to research that often supports conservative policy positions. Critics of AEI argue that its research can be biased towards promoting conservative viewpoints and policies, potentially overlooking or minimizing perspectives that advocate for more progressive or interventionist approaches. However, as a research associate, her role primarily involves supporting senior scholars and contributing to the research agenda.
