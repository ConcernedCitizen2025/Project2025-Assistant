**Position:** Senior Policy Analyst for Nuclear Deterrence and Missile Defense at The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Patty-Jane Geller served as a Senior Policy Analyst for Nuclear Deterrence and Missile Defense at The Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative think tank focused on national security and defense policies. In this role, she conducted research and advocated for strengthening the United States' nuclear deterrence capabilities and missile defense systems. Before joining The Heritage Foundation in 2020, Geller worked at the Senate Armed Services Committee, where she supported the Strategic Forces and Cybersecurity Subcommittees. Her work there included contributing to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, which led to the establishment of the United States Space Force. Geller holds a Bachelor of Arts in Government with a Minor in Physics from Georgetown University and a Master's degree in Military Operational Art and Science from the Air Command and Staff College.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Patty-Jane Gellerâ€™s policy positions on nuclear deterrence and missile defense align closely with the Trump administration's emphasis on enhancing U.S. military capabilities and national security. Although she did not hold a formal position within the Trump administration, her work at The Heritage Foundation supported and advanced policies that were consistent with the administration's focus on modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal and expanding missile defense systems.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Patty-Jane Geller has not been involved in any major personal scandals. Her work advocating for strong nuclear deterrence and missile defense can be polarizing, as it often intersects with broader debates on defense spending, arms control, and international security. However, there are no notable controversies directly associated with her personally.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Geller's advocacy for robust nuclear deterrence and the expansion of missile defense systems can be contentious. Critics may argue that such positions contribute to global arms races and increased militarization, which could escalate international tensions. Her support for modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal often faces opposition from those who prioritize arms control and disarmament efforts.
