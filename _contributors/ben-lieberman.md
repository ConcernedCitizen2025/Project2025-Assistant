# Ben Lieberman

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Senior Fellow, Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)

**Background:**  
Ben Lieberman is a Senior Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), where he specializes in environmental policy and energy issues. With a long history of advocating for deregulation, particularly in the energy sector, Lieberman has been a prominent voice against what he sees as excessive environmental regulations that stifle economic growth. He has published extensively on topics like climate change, energy efficiency standards, and the role of government in environmental policy.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Lieberman’s work aligns closely with the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back environmental regulations and promote fossil fuel production. His involvement in Project 2025 suggests a continued commitment to these goals. Project 2025 outlines a vision for a future conservative administration that includes significant cuts to environmental protections, a stance Lieberman has long supported. He has been directly involved in crafting the environmental and energy policies within this blueprint, which mirrors many of the deregulatory actions taken during Trump's presidency.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Ben Lieberman has been involved in several contentious debates over climate policy, particularly in his criticism of the scientific consensus on climate change. His stance against the regulation of greenhouse gases and his advocacy for policies that favor the fossil fuel industry have drawn significant criticism from environmental groups. The proposals within Project 2025, which Lieberman contributed to, have been described as extreme and potentially devastating for efforts to combat climate change.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Lieberman’s push to dismantle key environmental regulations and his involvement in Project 2025 raise concerns about the potential rollback of progress on climate action. The agenda he supports could significantly weaken the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other regulatory bodies, hindering their ability to enforce environmental protections and address climate-related challenges.
