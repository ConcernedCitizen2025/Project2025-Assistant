**Background:**  
Greg Walcher is a well-respected figure in natural resources policy, serving as the President of Natural Resources Group, LLC, a consulting firm specializing in issues related to energy, water, public lands, forestry, and wildlife. Walcher is also a Senior Advisor at Dawson & Associates, a Washington, D.C.-based environmental permitting firm, and a member of the Policy Advisory Board at the Heartland Institute.

**Relation to Trump:**  
While Greg Walcher does not have a direct connection to the Trump administration, his work in natural resources and environmental policy aligns with many of the administration's goals, particularly regarding the use of public lands and deregulation in the energy sector. His leadership in conservative environmental circles and his affiliation with organizations like the Heartland Institute, which has been supportive of Trumpâ€™s policies, ties him indirectly to the broader conservative movement that gained prominence during Trump's presidency.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Walcher has been a vocal critic of certain environmental policies, particularly those he views as overreach by federal agencies. His critiques have sometimes sparked controversy, especially among environmental groups that oppose his pro-development stance on issues like public land use and water rights. However, there are no significant personal scandals associated with him.
