# Mike Gonzalez

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Senior Fellow at The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Mike Gonzalez is the Angeles T. Arredondo E Pluribus Unum Senior Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, where he specializes in foreign policy, immigration, and identity politics. With a career that spans journalism, government service, and policy research, Gonzalez has become a prominent voice on conservative approaches to these topics. Before joining The Heritage Foundation, he spent nearly two decades as a journalist, including 15 years with *The Wall Street Journal*, reporting from Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He also served as a speechwriter for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and later at the U.S. Department of State under President George W. Bush. Gonzalez holds a BA in Communications from Emerson College and an MBA in International Finance from Columbia Business School.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Mike Gonzalez's work at The Heritage Foundation aligns closely with the policy goals of the Trump administration, particularly regarding immigration, national identity, and skepticism towards identity politics. Although Gonzalez did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, his advocacy and writings, such as his book *The Plot to Change America*, supported the administration's conservative agenda on these issues.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Mike Gonzalez has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, his strong stances on identity politics and his critiques of movements like Black Lives Matter, as expressed in his book *BLM: The Making of a New Marxist Revolution*, have sparked significant debate. His views are polarizing, drawing both support and criticism from various political and social groups.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Gonzalez's advocacy on contentious issues such as immigration and identity politics places him at the center of ongoing public debates. Critics argue that his views may marginalize minority groups and overlook the complexities of multicultural societies, while supporters praise his defense of American national identity and traditional values.
