# Max Eden

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI)

**Background:**  
Max Eden is a Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), where he focuses on education reform, with a particular emphasis on K–12 and early childhood education. He has a strong background in education policy, having previously served as a Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, where he engaged in extensive research and public commentary on school choice, school safety, and education reform. Eden is the coauthor of the Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestseller *Why Meadow Died: The People and Policies That Created the Parkland Shooter and Endanger America’s Students* (2019), which critiques policies that, according to him, contributed to the tragic Parkland school shooting. He has testified before Congress on issues such as school violence and the "school-to-prison pipeline" and has published widely in both policy journals and popular media outlets. Eden holds a BA in History from Yale University.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Max Eden's work at AEI aligns with the education policies promoted during the Trump administration, particularly those related to school choice, deregulation, and conservative approaches to education reform. Although Eden did not hold a formal position within the Trump administration, his research and advocacy support the broader conservative educational agenda that was emphasized during Trump’s tenure.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Max Eden has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his advocacy for school choice and his critiques of progressive education policies have placed him at the center of contentious debates in the education sector. His work on school safety, particularly in the context of the Parkland shooting, has been both praised and criticized, reflecting the divisive nature of contemporary education policy discussions.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Eden's strong advocacy for school choice and conservative education reform has been met with criticism from those who argue that such policies could undermine public education and increase educational inequality. His positions on school discipline and safety are also contentious, particularly in discussions about balancing order and equity in schools.
