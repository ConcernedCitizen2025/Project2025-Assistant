# Christopher Gacek

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Senior Fellow for Regulatory Affairs at the Family Research Council (FRC)

**Background:**  
Christopher Gacek is a Senior Fellow for Regulatory Affairs at the Family Research Council (FRC), a conservative Christian organization focused on promoting family values, religious liberty, and pro-life policies. He holds a JD from the University of Virginia School of Law and a PhD in Public Policy from George Mason University. Gacek has extensive experience in regulatory issues and advocacy, contributing to the FRC's mission by analyzing and promoting policies that align with conservative values.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Although Gacek did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, the Family Research Council's policy positions closely aligned with many of the social and religious priorities of the Trump administration. His work at the FRC supported and promoted policies consistent with the administration's agenda, particularly in areas related to religious liberty and pro-life issues.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Christopher Gacek has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his role at the FRC involves advocating for policies that are often highly controversial. The FRC’s positions on issues such as reproductive rights and LGBTQ rights frequently generate significant public and political debate, attracting both strong support and vigorous opposition.

**Potential Concerns:**  
The Family Research Council’s advocacy on social issues, including opposition to abortion and LGBTQ rights, places it at the center of heated public debates. Critics argue that the organization's positions can undermine civil rights and promote discrimination. As a senior fellow, Gacek’s work in regulatory affairs supports these advocacy efforts, which can be contentious and attract significant opposition from progressive groups and civil rights organizations.
