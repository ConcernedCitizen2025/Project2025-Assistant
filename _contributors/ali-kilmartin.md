**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Senior Counsel and Vice President of Allied Legal Affairs, Alliance Defending Freedom

**Background:**  
Ali Kilmartin serves as Senior Counsel and Vice President of Allied Legal Affairs at Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). In her role, she manages various legal initiatives and oversees the Grants Funding Program, which has provided approximately $55 million to various legal projects and cases. Kilmartin also serves as Chief of Staff to the CEO, President, and General Counsel at ADF. Her prior experience includes positions at the U.S. Department of Labor as Deputy Assistant Secretary and Deputy Chief of Staff, and as a Senior Advisor at the White House in the Office of Cabinet Affairs.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Ali Kilmartin’s association with Alliance Defending Freedom connects her to a network that has been influential during the Trump administration, especially in legal battles concerning religious freedom and conservative social policies. ADF has worked closely with Trump-aligned figures and has been a strong advocate for many policies supported by his administration, particularly those related to religious liberty and opposition to LGBTQ rights.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
- **Alliance Defending Freedom's Legal Battles:** ADF, where Kilmartin holds a senior position, has been involved in numerous high-profile and contentious legal battles, particularly those involving LGBTQ rights, abortion, and religious freedom. The organization has been designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center due to its extreme positions on LGBTQ issues, which has attracted significant criticism and media scrutiny.
- **Judicial Connections:** ADF’s influence extends into the judicial sphere, with several Trump-appointed judges having ties to the organization. This connection has been highlighted in cases where ADF has been involved in key legal decisions, further entrenching its role in shaping conservative legal strategies.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Kilmartin’s work with ADF involves advocating for policies that intersect with contentious social and legal issues, particularly around religious freedom and LGBTQ rights. ADF’s legal strategies and stances have been both criticized and supported, making her work polarizing and subject to significant public scrutiny.
