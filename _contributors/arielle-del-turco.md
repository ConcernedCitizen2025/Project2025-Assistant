**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Assistant Director of the Center for Religious Liberty at the Family Research Council (FRC)

**Background:**  
Arielle Del Turco serves as the Assistant Director of the Center for Religious Liberty at the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian organization focused on promoting religious freedom, family values, and traditional marriage. In her role, Del Turco advocates for policies that protect religious liberties both domestically and internationally. She is involved in research, policy analysis, and public speaking on issues related to religious freedom and human rights. Del Turco holds a BA in Government and International Politics from George Mason University.

**Relation to Trump:**  
The Family Research Council and its policy positions were closely aligned with many of the social and religious priorities of the Trump administration. The administration's focus on religious freedom, opposition to abortion, and support for traditional family values mirrored the advocacy efforts of the FRC. While Arielle Del Turco did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, her work at FRC supported and complemented the administration's policy goals. She has been a vocal advocate for religious freedom in the context of the 2024 Republican Party platform, which continues to reflect many of the principles upheld during Trumpâ€™s presidency.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Arielle Del Turco has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, her work at the Family Research Council, an organization frequently involved in contentious policy debates, places her at the center of ongoing controversies related to religious liberty, reproductive rights, and LGBTQ rights. The FRC's advocacy efforts often attract strong support from conservative circles and vigorous opposition from progressive groups and civil rights organizations.

**Potential Concerns:**  
The Family Research Council's strong stance on conservative social issues, including opposition to abortion and LGBTQ rights, often places it at the center of heated public debates. Critics argue that FRC's positions can undermine civil rights and promote discrimination. Del Turco's work advocating for religious freedom may be viewed as contentious by those who believe it conflicts with other rights and liberties. The organization has been designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center due to its positions on LGBTQ issues, which adds to the controversy surrounding its advocacy work.
