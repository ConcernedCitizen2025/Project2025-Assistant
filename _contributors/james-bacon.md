**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Former Senior Advisor for Strategic Communications at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

**Background:**  
James Bacon served as a Senior Advisor for Strategic Communications at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration. Before his role at DHS, Bacon worked in various capacities within the federal government, including roles focused on public affairs and strategic communications. He holds a BA from the University of Texas at Austin. Notably, Bacon was also involved in the Trump administration's Presidential Personnel Office, where he played a role in the administration's efforts to ensure loyalty among political appointees.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Bacon's position at DHS tied him directly to the Trump administration's efforts to control the narrative on immigration and national security. His work involved crafting and disseminating messages that aligned with the administration's hardline policies and public stance on these issues. Additionally, his involvement in the Presidential Personnel Office connected him to the administration's internal efforts to consolidate loyalty among federal employees.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
While James Bacon has not been personally involved in major scandals, his tenure at DHS coincided with several controversial policies and actions, including the implementation of the zero-tolerance policy that led to family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border. The communication strategies surrounding such policies were often criticized for their lack of transparency and for spreading fear among immigrant communities. His work in the Presidential Personnel Office also attracted attention due to the administration's aggressive push to ensure loyalty among its appointees.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Bacon's role in strategic communications at DHS placed him at the center of the administration's messaging on key issues such as immigration enforcement and national security. Critics argue that the communication strategies employed during his tenure often contributed to heightened public fears and misinformation regarding immigration and security threats. The administration's approach to these topics has been contentious and polarizing.
