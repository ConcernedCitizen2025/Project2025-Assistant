**Position:** Director of Investigations, Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI)

**Background:**  
Matt O’Brien brings nearly 30 years of expertise in immigration law to his role as Director of Investigations at the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI). In this capacity, he is responsible for overseeing investigations into immigration fraud, misconduct, and enforcement issues. Prior to joining IRLI, O’Brien served as an Immigration Judge at the U.S. Immigration Court in Arlington, Virginia, and led the National Security Division at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). He also worked as an Assistant Chief Counsel with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), gaining extensive experience in immigration law and policy enforcement.

**Relation to Trump:**

His work at IRLI continues to reflect these priorities, focusing on investigating and challenging practices and policies that are seen as undermining strict immigration enforcement. O’Brien’s efforts during and after the Trump administration underscore his commitment to advancing the administration's hardline stance on immigration.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Matt O’Brien’s advocacy for stringent immigration policies and his association with IRLI, an organization linked to the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), have led to both support and criticism. His strong positions on immigration reform have sparked debates and controversy within various political and social circles.
