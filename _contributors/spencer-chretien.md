# Spencer Chretien

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Associate Director of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project at The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Spencer Chretien served as an Associate Director of Presidential Personnel at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during the Trump administration from 2020 to 2021. In this role, he was responsible for the identification, recruitment, and placement of hundreds of political appointees across various levels of the federal government. Prior to his tenure at OMB, Chretien held roles in other governmental and conservative organizations, including a position as a political appointee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). His extensive background in political strategy and public policy includes work with prominent conservative groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, Citizens Against Government Waste, and FreedomWorks. Chretien holds a Bachelor of Arts in Government from The College of William and Mary and is also a graduate of Hillsdale College’s James Madison Fellowship Program[^26][^27].

**Relation to Trump:**  
Spencer Chretien played a crucial role in the Trump administration as Associate Director of Presidential Personnel, where he was instrumental in advancing the administration's agenda through strategic staffing decisions. His responsibilities included identifying, recruiting, and placing political appointees across the federal government, ensuring alignment with Trump’s priorities. Chretien also served as Special Assistant to the President in 2020 and 2021, further solidifying his involvement in the administration’s operations. His current role as Associate Director of Project 2025 continues his focus on shaping government personnel in alignment with Trump’s vision.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
While Spencer Chretien himself has not been involved in any major personal scandals, the broader approach to personnel management during the Trump administration, which he was part of, attracted significant controversy. The administration's emphasis on loyalty and ideological alignment in its staffing decisions often led to criticism that competence and experience were sidelined. This approach was seen by many as a means to further entrench political influence within the federal bureaucracy, raising concerns about the impact on the impartiality and effectiveness of government operations[^28].

**Potential Concerns:**  
Chretien's involvement in Project 2025, where he currently serves as Associate Director, also raises concerns. Project 2025 is an ambitious initiative led by The Heritage Foundation, aiming to reshape federal governance significantly. Critics argue that the project’s focus on deconstructing the administrative state could lead to further polarization and destabilization of federal agencies. Chretien's role in such a project, given his background in staffing during the Trump administration, suggests continuity in the strategy of embedding loyalists within key government positions[^28].
