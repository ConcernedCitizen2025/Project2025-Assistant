**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Former Chief of Staff U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)

**Background:**  
Chris Anderson served as Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Labor during the Trump administration, where he played a key role in advancing the administration's labor policies. He holds a JD from George Washington University Law School and a BA from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Before his tenure at the DOL, Anderson held various positions in both the public and private sectors, focusing on legislative affairs and policy development.

**Relation to Trump:**  
In his role at the Department of Labor, Anderson worked closely with Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia to implement policies that were aligned with the Trump administration's goals. His work supported the administration's efforts to deregulate industries and reduce the influence of labor unions, aligning closely with Trump's broader economic and regulatory agenda.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
While Chris Anderson has not been involved in any major personal scandals, his time at the Department of Labor was marked by policy shifts that were controversial. These included efforts to roll back regulations such as the joint-employer rule and overtime protections, which were met with opposition from labor unions and worker advocacy groups who argued these changes could negatively impact worker rights and benefits.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Anderson's involvement in advancing the Trump administration's labor policies, which emphasized deregulation and reduced union influence, may raise concerns about the balance between economic growth and worker rights. Critics argue that these policies favored business interests over those of employees, potentially undermining worker protections.
