# Mark Robeck

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Former Deputy General Counsel for Energy Policy, U.S. Department of Energy

**Background:**  
Mark Robeck is a highly experienced attorney with over 30 years of legal expertise in the energy sector. He has held prominent roles in both the public and private sectors, specializing in dispute resolution, risk management, and compliance counseling. Before entering public service, Robeck was a partner at Kelly Drye & Warren LLP and Baker Botts LLP, where he co-headed the Energy Practice Group and Energy Litigation Practice Group, respectively.

In 2019, Robeck was appointed as the Deputy General Counsel for Energy Policy at the U.S. Department of Energy under the Trump administration. In this capacity, he advised Department leadership on legal and policy issues related to energy initiatives, interagency engagements, rule-making, and significant litigation. His work was instrumental in shaping the Department's energy policies, particularly those aligned with the Trump administration's focus on deregulation and fossil fuel development.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Mark Robeck's role as Deputy General Counsel for Energy Policy at the Department of Energy directly connected him to the Trump administration’s energy strategy, which emphasized energy independence, increased fossil fuel production, and reduced regulatory burdens. Robeck provided legal counsel on several key initiatives, including those that involved the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and the Keystone XL pipeline. His work supported the administration's goals of enhancing U.S. energy infrastructure and ensuring energy security.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
There are no significant scandals or controversies directly associated with Mark Robeck. However, his public critiques of the Biden administration's energy policies, particularly regarding the release of oil from the SPR, have stirred debate. Robeck has argued that such actions threaten national security and do not address the root causes of high energy prices.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Robeck’s strong advocacy for fossil fuel policies and his critiques of regulatory measures designed to address climate change reflect a broader tension between energy policy objectives and environmental concerns. His influence on policy during the Trump administration, particularly in supporting deregulation, is viewed by some as prioritizing industry interests over environmental protections.
