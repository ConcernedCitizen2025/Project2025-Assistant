# John Berlau

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Senior Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)

**Background:**  
John Berlau is a Senior Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, where he focuses on financial policy, regulation, and entrepreneurship. Berlau is an author and journalist who has written extensively on financial regulation, capital markets, and the impact of government policies on innovation and entrepreneurship. He holds a BA from the University of Missouri-Columbia.

**Relation to Trump:**  
John Berlau's policy positions and work at CEI align with many of the Trump administration's economic policies, which prioritized deregulation and reducing the regulatory burden on businesses. Although Berlau did not serve directly in the Trump administration, his research and advocacy supported the administration's efforts to roll back financial regulations implemented after the 2008 financial crisis.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
John Berlau has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, his strong advocacy for deregulation and his association with CEI, a think tank known for its libertarian stance and opposition to many regulatory policies, have been controversial. His positions on financial regulation and consumer protection often draw criticism from those who support stronger regulatory frameworks to prevent financial crises and protect consumers.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Berlau's work at CEI often emphasizes the need for deregulation and reducing government intervention in the financial sector. Critics argue that his positions could potentially weaken consumer protections and oversight, increasing the risk of financial instability and harm to consumers. His strong advocacy for free-market principles can be contentious in debates over the appropriate level of regulation in financial markets.
