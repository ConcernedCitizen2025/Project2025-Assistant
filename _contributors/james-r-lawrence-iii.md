**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Partner at Envisage Law

**Background:**  
James R. Lawrence III is a partner at Envisage Law, where he specializes in regulatory law, litigation, intellectual property, complex commercial transactions, and corporate governance. Lawrence has an extensive background in both the private and public sectors. He served as Deputy General Counsel at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and as Chief Counsel of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Trump administration. His work at HHS included dealing with significant regulatory issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, and he played a key role in shaping legal strategies for the FDA. Before joining the Trump administration, Lawrence held positions at several law firms, including Michael Best & Friedrich LLP, and worked as general counsel for a drug company. He holds a JD from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a BS in Biomedical Engineering from North Carolina State University.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Lawrence's tenure as Deputy General Counsel at HHS and Chief Counsel at the FDA directly aligns him with the Trump administration's policies, particularly those involving health care regulation and pharmaceutical policy. His work during the COVID-19 pandemic and his involvement in regulatory reforms reflect the administration's priorities in these areas. After leaving the administration, Lawrence continued to engage in legal work that aligns with conservative principles, including cases related to Big Tech censorship.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
James R. Lawrence III has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his professional work, particularly in high-stakes regulatory and litigation matters, places him in the midst of significant public and legal debates. His roles during the Trump administration, especially concerning health care and FDA regulations, often placed him at the center of contentious policy discussions.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Lawrence's involvement in high-profile litigation and regulatory matters, particularly those involving Big Tech censorship and health care regulations, can be contentious. His roles in the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic also draw attention, as critics might scrutinize the administration's handling of health care regulations during that time.
