# Alexei Woltornist

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Co-Founder, ATHOS

**Background:**  
Alexei Woltornist is a seasoned communications and public relations expert with a decade of experience advising non-profits, government leaders, and public figures. He is the co-founder of ATHOS, a public relations firm where he specializes in strategic communications, government relations, and media outreach. Prior to founding ATHOS, Woltornist served as the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the Trump administration. In this role, he managed all outreach and media relations efforts for the department, directing a team of over 800 communications professionals. His responsibilities included overseeing strategic, incident, and internal communications, and serving as the principal communications advisor to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Woltornist was recognized with the Outstanding Service Medal from the Secretary of Homeland Security for his contributions during his tenure.

Before his work at DHS, Woltornist was a spokesman at the U.S. Department of Justice, where he led communications efforts for the Antitrust Division and managed media engagement for high-profile investigations, including those involving Big Tech. He also served as the Communications Director for the Republican Study Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he worked on advancing conservative policies under the chairmanship of Rep. Mark Walker.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Woltornist’s role as Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at DHS placed him at the heart of the Trump administration’s communications strategy, where he was instrumental in shaping the public narrative on key national security issues. He played a significant role in managing the administration’s response to crises, such as hurricanes and cybersecurity breaches, and was a key figure in promoting the administration’s policies through conservative media outlets. His involvement with Project 2025 further cements his connection to Trump’s broader political agenda. In this initiative, Woltornist has been featured in training videos advising future political appointees on effectively communicating with the public and media, specifically encouraging engagement with conservative media channels to reach their audience.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Woltornist has not been directly involved in any significant scandals. However, his communications strategies, particularly those that focus on circumventing mainstream media in favor of conservative outlets, have been a point of contention. Critics argue that this approach reinforces echo chambers and limits public discourse to more ideologically aligned channels.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Woltornist’s strong alignment with conservative media strategies and his advisory role in Project 2025 raise concerns about the potential for biased communication tactics in future conservative administrations. His focus on steering public discourse through selective media engagement could further polarize the political landscape.
