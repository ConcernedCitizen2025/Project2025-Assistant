# Alexei Woltornist

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Former Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

**Background:**  
Alexei Woltornist served as the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security under the Trump administration. In this role, he was responsible for managing the department's communications strategy and served as a key spokesperson on homeland security issues. Woltornist has been involved in conservative policy-making circles and continues to influence strategies through his contributions to Project 2025.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Woltornist's connection to Trump is significant, having been a prominent figure in Trump's DHS. His involvement in Project 2025 further cements his ties to Trump's broader policy agenda. Project 2025, which is often seen as a blueprint for a potential second Trump administration, includes numerous former Trump officials like Woltornist who are preparing to implement conservative policies if Trump or another Republican candidate wins the presidency in 2024.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Woltornist was featured in leaked training videos from Project 2025, where he and other former Trump officials discussed strategies for overhauling government agencies to align with conservative values. These videos have sparked controversy due to the radical nature of some of the proposals, such as dismantling existing government structures and aggressively promoting a conservative agenda. While these plans are contentious, they reflect the strong ideological commitment of those involved in Project 2025.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Woltornist's role in Project 2025 raises concerns about the extent to which he and others might push for drastic changes within the federal government, potentially leading to significant upheaval in established agencies. The strategies discussed in the training videos, such as reclassifying federal employees to replace them with political appointees, could fundamentally alter the functioning of government institutions.
