**Background:**  
Mike Howell is the Executive Director of the Oversight Project at The Heritage Foundation, where he leads the organization's efforts to investigate and challenge progressive policies through strategic oversight and litigation. He joined The Heritage Foundation in October 2018, after serving in the Trump administration as Chief Legal Point of Contact for congressional oversight at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Howell’s career on Capitol Hill included roles as an attorney for the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the House Oversight Committee, where he led national security investigations into various controversies during the Obama administration. Howell holds a JD from Emory Law School and a BA from Duke University.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Mike Howell’s work closely aligns with the priorities of the Trump administration, particularly in areas like immigration, border security, and holding the federal government accountable. His current role at The Heritage Foundation continues this alignment, as he directs efforts to scrutinize and challenge the policies of the Biden administration, echoing the conservative principles central to Trump’s presidency.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Mike Howell has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, his work, particularly his aggressive stance on immigration and his investigative tactics, has been contentious. His efforts to use oversight and litigation to challenge the policies of the Biden administration have sparked significant debate, with critics arguing that his methods can be invasive and divisive.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Howell’s work in directing the Oversight Project at The Heritage Foundation, particularly its focus on using litigation and investigations to target progressive policies, has drawn criticism. Some argue that his approach may contribute to heightened political polarization and undermine initiatives aimed at fostering social equity.
