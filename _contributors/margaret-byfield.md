# Margaret Byfield

**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Executive Director of American Stewards of Liberty

**Background:**  
Margaret Byfield is the Executive Director of American Stewards of Liberty (ASL), an organization dedicated to advocating for property rights and local control over land use. She became actively involved in the property rights movement following her parents' legal battle against the U.S. government, known as *Hage v. United States*. This case, which began in 1991, was a landmark legal fight over federal land use that significantly influenced her career. In 1992, she founded Stewards of the Range to support landowners facing similar federal overreach issues. This organization later merged with the American Land Foundation to form ASL in 2009. Byfield has since led numerous successful initiatives, including helping to defeat the I-35 Trans Texas Corridor project and preventing the endangered listing of the Dunes Sagebrush Lizard. She holds a BA in English and Music from the College of Idaho.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Margaret Byfield's work at ASL aligns closely with the Trump administration's policies, particularly regarding deregulation and promoting local control over land use. The Trump administrationâ€™s efforts to reduce federal regulations and return decision-making power to local governments reflect the principles Byfield has long advocated through her organization.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Margaret Byfield has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, her staunch opposition to federal land use regulations and her advocacy for property rights have placed her at the center of significant political and environmental debates. These issues are often contentious, attracting both support and criticism from different stakeholders.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Byfield's strong advocacy against federal land regulations and for local control has sparked controversy, particularly among environmental groups who argue that such positions may undermine conservation efforts and public land management. Her work frequently brings her into conflict with federal authorities and environmentalists, making her a polarizing figure in these debates.
