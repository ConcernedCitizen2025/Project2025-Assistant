Throughout his military career, Deptula played key roles, including serving as the principal attack planner for the Operation Desert Storm air campaign and as the Air Force's first Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). He holds a degree from the U.S. Air Force Academy and advanced degrees from several institutions, including a Master's in National Security Strategy from the National War College.

**Relation to Trump:**  
While David Deptula did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, his work at the Mitchell Institute intersects with broader defense policy discussions that were relevant during Trump's presidency. His advocacy for robust airpower and modernization of aerospace capabilities aligns with the administration’s emphasis on military strength. Additionally, his involvement in shaping U.S. doctrine regarding the use of drones and ISR reflects key areas of focus under Trump's defense strategy.

David Deptula has not been involved in any major personal scandals. His professional work as a military officer and later as a think tank leader has been focused on advancing aerospace strategy and advocating for airpower. While his positions and advocacy efforts are subject to debate within the defense community, there are no notable scandals or controversies directly linked to him.

**Potential Concerns:**  
As a prominent advocate for airpower and aerospace strategy, Deptula’s positions may attract scrutiny, particularly in debates over military spending, the balance between different branches of the armed forces, and the role of unmanned systems and AI in warfare. Critics may argue that his strong advocacy for airpower could overshadow other defense priorities or raise concerns about the ethical implications of drone warfare and surveillance practices.
