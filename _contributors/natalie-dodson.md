**Role:** Contributor

**Position:** Policy Analyst at the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC)

**Background:**  
Natalie Dodson is a Policy Analyst at the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), where she contributes to various initiatives focusing on issues such as sexuality, gender ideology, religious liberty, healthcare rights of conscience, abortion, and nondiscrimination. She plays a key role in EPPC’s HHS Accountability Project, working on policy research and advocacy that align with the center’s mission to apply Judeo-Christian moral principles to contemporary public policy debates. Before joining EPPC, Dodson was a Government Affairs Fellow at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, where she defended religious freedom. She holds a BA in Politics with a concentration in Legal Studies from the University of Dallas and is currently pursuing an MA in Government at Hillsdale College.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Natalie Dodson's work at EPPC aligns with the conservative principles that were central to the Trump administration's policies, particularly in areas related to religious liberty and social conservatism. While Dodson did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, her policy advocacy supports many of the same goals and priorities that were prominent during Trump's presidency.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Natalie Dodson has not been involved in any major personal scandals. Her work, particularly in controversial areas like gender ideology and religious liberty, places her in the midst of ongoing public debates. However, there are no notable controversies directly associated with her personally.

**Potential Concerns:**  
As a policy analyst focusing on contentious issues such as gender ideology and religious liberty, Dodson's work at EPPC can attract criticism from those with differing views, particularly regarding the center’s conservative stance on these issues. The scrutiny of funding sources and the transparency of EPPC’s fundraising processes may also be areas of concern.
