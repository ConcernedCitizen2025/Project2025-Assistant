Appointed by Trump, Moley was responsible for overseeing the U.S. approach to multilateral institutions and international cooperation. His position involved significant influence over how the U.S. engaged with and challenged international organizations, aligning with Trump's broader foreign policy objectives of reshaping global institutions and reducing U.S. involvement in international agreements deemed unfavorable to American interests.
