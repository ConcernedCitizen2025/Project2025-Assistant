**Relation to Trump:**  
There is no direct public information indicating that Nathan Hitchen held a formal position in the Trump administration. However, his conservative advocacy, particularly in the anti-abortion movement, aligns ideologically with the values and policies promoted by the Trump administration. His contributions to Project 2025 further suggest a connection to conservative policy agendas that were prominent during Trump's presidency.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Hitchenâ€™s involvement with conservative advocacy groups, particularly his leadership role in the anti-abortion movement, may draw criticism from those who oppose these views. His policy stances and affiliations are likely to be polarizing in public discourse, particularly in the context of ongoing debates around abortion and conservative social policies.
