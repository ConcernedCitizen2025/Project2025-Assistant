<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> President of Personnel Policy Operations, Senior Advisor at America First Policy Institutes, America First Transition Project</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Troup Hemenway is a prominent figure in conservative policy and personnel management. He currently serves as the President of Personnel Policy Operations, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting conservative engagement in civic activities. Hemenway is also a Senior Advisor at the America First Policy Institutes’ America First Transition Project. His experience includes serving as an Associate Director for National Security in the Trump White House’s Presidential Personnel Office (PPO), where he oversaw appointments in key departments such as Defense, Homeland Security, Energy, and the Intelligence Community. Hemenway has also held senior roles at the Pentagon, including as a Senior Advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and he played a significant role in the Trump 2016 campaign and subsequent transition team.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Hemenway served as Associate Director for National Security in the White House Presidential Personnel Office, where he was involved in vetting new appointees. He also founded the Association of Republican Presidential Appointees. His role in the Trump administration through the Presidential Personnel Office and his contributions to Project 2025 align closely with Trump’s policies and principles. His ongoing work with Project 2025 reflects a continued commitment to Trump’s vision for government reform.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Troup Hemenway has not been involved in any major personal scandals. His professional focus on conservative policy and personnel management reforms, while contentious and subject to political debate, has not resulted in notable personal controversies. However, his work within the Trump administration and his role in Project 2025 have placed him at the center of significant political debates regarding the future direction of federal governance.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Hemenway’s involvement in conservative personnel policy and operations, particularly through Project 2025, could attract scrutiny due to the proposed reforms aimed at restructuring the federal workforce. These reforms are seen by critics as efforts to politicize the federal workforce and reduce its independence. His work emphasizes reducing the size and scope of the federal government and addressing what he and his colleagues view as an overly expansive and politicized bureaucracy. Additionally, his strong alignment with the Trump administration’s agenda, particularly in national security and defense, highlights potential concerns regarding the centralization of power within certain ideological frameworks.</p>
