<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Adviser to the Deputy Director, U.S. Census Bureau; American Principles Project</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Adam Korzeniewski is a combat veteran of the United States Marine Corps and has served in various influential roles within the Trump administration, specifically in the Treasury Department and Commerce Department. His areas of expertise include financial policy, trade, industrial policy, national security, and the census. At the Treasury Department, Korzeniewski was involved in developing and implementing key financial policies aligned with the administration’s goals. He later served as Senior Adviser to the Deputy Director at the U.S. Census Bureau, where he played a significant role in shaping the bureau’s policies and operations during a critical period.</p>

<p>Following his time in government, Korzeniewski became associated with the American Principles Project (APP), an organization focused on conservative advocacy, particularly in areas related to family and social issues. The APP has been instrumental in promoting policies that align with the Trump administration’s views on these topics. In 2021, Korzeniewski was appointed by President Trump to the Presidential Council for Improving Federal Civic Architecture, further solidifying his influence in the Trump administration’s efforts to reshape federal policy and governance.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Adam Korzeniewski’s work in the Trump administration, particularly at the U.S. Census Bureau and Treasury Department, places him at the heart of several key initiatives that were central to Trump’s policy agenda. At the Census Bureau, he was involved in the controversial management of the 2020 Census, an effort marked by attempts to include a citizenship question—a move widely seen as aligned with Trump’s broader immigration and voter identification policies. His role at the Treasury Department also connected him to significant financial and economic decisions during Trump’s tenure.</p>

<p>Korzeniewski’s continued involvement with the American Principles Project, a group that strongly supports Trump’s platform, further underscores his alignment with the former president’s political strategies. The APP’s advocacy for conservative social policies, particularly those related to family and education, reflects the broader agenda promoted by Trump and his allies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Census Bureau Role:</strong> Korzeniewski’s role at the Census Bureau was part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to influence the 2020 Census, including attempts to add a citizenship question. These efforts were met with legal challenges and widespread controversy, as critics argued that such moves were intended to impact the apportionment of congressional seats and the allocation of federal resources in favor of Republican strongholds.</li>
  <li><strong>Super PAC Involvement:</strong> Korzeniewski has been linked to the creation of a Super PAC aimed at promoting conservative candidates and causes. This initiative is part of a broader effort to establish a conservative ecosystem free from liberal influence, sparking debate and concern among various political groups.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Korzeniewski’s involvement with the American Principles Project and his work within the Trump administration align him with a conservative agenda that often involves contentious social and political issues. His work has been polarizing, attracting both support and criticism, particularly from those on opposite ends of the political spectrum. His involvement in the 2020 Census management has raised concerns about the politicization of federal data collection efforts and the potential long-term impacts on representation and resource allocation.</p>
