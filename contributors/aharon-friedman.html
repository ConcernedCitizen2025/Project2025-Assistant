<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Director at the Federal Policy Group</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Aharon Friedman is a Director at the Federal Policy Group where he focuses on tax policy and legislative strategies. Before joining the Federal Policy Group, Friedman served as Senior Tax Counsel to the House Ways and Means Committee and as Tax Counsel to Congressman Kevin Brady. He has extensive experience in tax law and policy, having played a significant role in crafting tax legislation, including the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Friedman holds a JD from Harvard Law School and a BA from Yeshiva University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Friedman’s work on tax policy aligns with many of the priorities of the Trump administration, particularly the focus on tax cuts and reforms that were central to the administration’s economic agenda. His experience with the House Ways and Means Committee and involvement in crafting tax legislation positioned him to influence policies consistent with the administration’s goals.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Dispute:</strong> Aharon Friedman was involved in a highly publicized personal dispute over his refusal to grant his ex-wife a religious divorce, known as a “get,” which led to protests and public criticism. This issue drew significant attention within the Jewish community and was widely covered in the media. The controversy did not relate directly to his professional role but did place him in the public eye.</li>
  <li><strong>Lobbying and Advocacy:</strong> As a lobbyist and policy advisor, Friedman’s close connections with lawmakers and his influence on tax policy are often subject to scrutiny, particularly in discussions about the equity and effectiveness of tax reforms. His work in this area has been contentious, especially among those who debate the impacts of tax cuts on different segments of the population.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Friedman’s work in tax policy and his role in shaping significant tax legislation can be contentious, especially among critics who argue that certain tax policies favor the wealthy and corporations, potentially increasing income inequality. His involvement in lobbying and policy development continues to draw attention and critique.</p>
