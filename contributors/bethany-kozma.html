<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Founder and CEO, Keystone Policy</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Bethany Kozma is the founder and CEO of Keystone Policy, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing policies that protect life, religious liberty, and family values. Kozma has a rich background in government service, having held multiple senior roles during the Trump administration. She served as the Deputy Chief of Staff at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), where she was instrumental in aligning the agency’s global investments with the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy. This included promoting pro-family, pro-life, and religious liberty initiatives on an international scale. Prior to her role at USAID, Kozma worked in the White House during the George W. Bush administration, the Department of Homeland Security, and within the Intelligence Community, focusing on national security and anti-terrorism efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Bethany Kozma’s roles in the Trump administration were pivotal in promoting and implementing the administration’s conservative agenda. As Deputy Chief of Staff at USAID, she ensured that the agency’s policies supported the administration’s objectives, particularly in areas related to family and religious values. Kozma was also deeply involved in Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative aimed at preparing for a potential future Trump administration. Through this project, she advocated for significant changes in government policy, including those related to climate change and gender ideology, reflecting the broader conservative values endorsed by the Trump administration.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Kozma has been at the center of several controversies due to her conservative stance on various issues. Her opposition to comprehensive sexuality education and her declaration at international forums, such as the United Nations, that the U.S. is a “pro-life nation” have been particularly contentious. Furthermore, her involvement in Project 2025, where she has minimized the importance of addressing climate change and suggested it is used as a pretext for population control, has drawn criticism from environmentalists and progressive groups alike.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Kozma’s strong advocacy for pro-life and conservative family values, along with her influence on global health and education policies, has led to significant debate. Her views on gender identity, climate change, and educational programs have been polarizing, raising concerns among those who argue that her positions could undermine more progressive policies and efforts in these areas.</p>
