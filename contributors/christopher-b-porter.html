<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former National Intelligence Officer for Cyber, National Intelligence Council</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Christopher B. Porter has held several influential roles in both the public and private sectors, making significant contributions to national cybersecurity policy. From 2019 to 2022, he served as the National Intelligence Officer for Cyber at the National Intelligence Council (NIC), where he led the U.S. Intelligence Community’s analysis of foreign cyber threats and election security. In this role, Porter was the principal cyber intelligence advisor to the Director of National Intelligence, providing critical insights and briefings to top U.S. officials, including the President, senior Cabinet members, and military leaders.</p>

<p>Before his time at the NIC, Porter was the Chief Technology Officer for Global Cybersecurity Policy at FireEye, a leading cybersecurity firm. At FireEye, he managed strategic intelligence operations and was instrumental in developing the company’s intelligence products, which reached thousands of customers worldwide. His earlier career includes nearly nine years at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), where he earned several awards for his contributions to national intelligence, including the National Intelligence Analysis Award and the Cyber Threats Group Director’s Award for Innovation.</p>

<p>Porter’s expertise has also made him a sought-after commentator on cybersecurity issues, with his insights featured in major publications and media outlets. Currently, he serves as the Head of International Security Cooperation at Google Cloud, where he continues to influence global cybersecurity strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
During the Trump administration, Christopher Porter was appointed as the National Intelligence Officer for Cyber at the National Intelligence Council in 2019. In this capacity, he played a key role in shaping the administration’s approach to cybersecurity, particularly in response to foreign cyber threats and safeguarding U.S. elections. Porter’s work under both the Trump and Biden administrations positioned him as a central figure in national cyber policy, providing critical intelligence that influenced decision-making at the highest levels of government.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
There are no significant scandals or controversies directly associated with Christopher Porter. His work has generally been well-regarded within the intelligence and cybersecurity communities, and he has maintained a reputation for innovation and leadership in his field.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Porter’s involvement in high-stakes cybersecurity decisions, especially concerning election security and foreign threats, places him in a critical position of influence. As cybersecurity remains a contentious and politically sensitive issue, the decisions and analyses provided by Porter during his tenure could be scrutinized by different political and public stakeholders.</p>
