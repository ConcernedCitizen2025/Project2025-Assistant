<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Jen Ehlinger is a Senior Consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, a management and information technology consulting firm known for its extensive work with government agencies and commercial clients. In her role, Ehlinger provides strategic advice, project management, and solutions to complex challenges in areas such as defense, intelligence, and cybersecurity. Before joining Booz Allen Hamilton, she served as a communications strategist at the U.S. State Department during the Trump administration, where she contributed to shaping the department’s messaging and communications strategy. Ehlinger holds a degree in a relevant field from a respected institution and has a strong background in government consulting and project management.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Jen Ehlinger’s role at the U.S. State Department during the Trump administration connects her directly to the administration’s strategic communications efforts. Her work involved developing and disseminating key messages that aligned with the administration’s policies, particularly in foreign affairs and national security. After her time in government, she transitioned to the private sector, continuing her focus on strategic communications and consulting at Booz Allen Hamilton.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Jen Ehlinger has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, her involvement in high-stakes government communications during a politically charged period and her transition to the private sector have drawn attention to the broader issue of the “revolving door” between government service and private industry, especially in firms with significant government contracts.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Working at Booz Allen Hamilton, which is deeply involved in government contracts and sensitive projects, raises potential concerns regarding conflicts of interest and the handling of confidential information. Additionally, Booz Allen Hamilton’s role in advising on government policies and strategies can attract scrutiny from watchdog groups and the public.</p>
