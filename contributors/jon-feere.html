<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Director of Investigations at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Jon Feere is the Director of Investigations at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that promotes stricter immigration controls and enforcement policies. Before joining CIS, Feere served as Senior Advisor to the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during the Trump administration, where he was involved in policy development and enforcement strategies. He has a background in law and public policy, focusing extensively on immigration issues. Feere holds a JD from American University Washington College of Law.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Jon Feere’s role as Senior Advisor to the Director of ICE during the Trump administration placed him at the center of the administration’s efforts to implement stricter immigration policies. His work at ICE and his current role at CIS are aligned with the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, which emphasized enforcement, border security, and reductions in both legal and illegal immigration.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Jon Feere has been involved in numerous controversial policy debates, particularly during his tenure at ICE. The Trump administration’s immigration policies, including family separations at the border, increased detentions, and aggressive deportation tactics, were highly controversial and led to significant public outcry. Feere’s involvement in these policies makes him a prominent figure in these contentious discussions, attracting both strong support and vocal opposition.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Feere’s strong advocacy for stringent immigration controls and enforcement can be highly contentious. Critics argue that the policies he supports may contribute to harsh treatment of immigrants and undermine the rights of undocumented individuals. His tenure at ICE under the Trump administration, a period marked by controversial immigration policies such as family separations and increased deportations, attracts significant scrutiny and opposition from immigrant rights groups and advocates.</p>
