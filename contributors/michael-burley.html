He is also the Co-Director of the Centre for Philosophy of Religion at Leeds and has a significant academic background that includes a BA from the University of Essex, an MA in Indian philosophy from the University of Nottingham, and a PhD from the University of Bristol. His work is influenced by thinkers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and D. Z. Phillips, and he has developed a methodological approach that combines philosophy with cultural anthropology.</p>

While his work may engage with complex and sometimes controversial topics, such as religious pluralism and ethics, there are no notable controversies directly associated with him.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />

His methodological approach, which emphasizes understanding religious practices and beliefs within their cultural contexts, may attract criticism from those with differing perspectives on these deeply held beliefs and philosophical viewpoints.</p>
