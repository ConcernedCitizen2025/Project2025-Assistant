<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Director of National Intelligence; Senior Advisor at American Global Strategies</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
John Ratcliffe is an American politician, attorney, and former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) under President Donald Trump. As the DNI, he served as the principal intelligence advisor to the President and led the U.S. intelligence community, which includes 18 federal agencies. During his tenure, Ratcliffe focused on counterintelligence, cybersecurity, and enhancing the U.S.’s strategic position against China. He also played a key role in integrating the U.S. Space Force into the intelligence community.</p>

<p>Before serving as DNI, Ratcliffe represented Texas’s 4th congressional district from 2015 to 2020. He was known for his work on cybersecurity legislation and served on the House Intelligence, Homeland Security, and Judiciary Committees. Prior to his congressional career, Ratcliffe served as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas and was involved in anti-terrorism initiatives.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
John Ratcliffe served as the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) from May 2020 to January 2021 under President Trump. In this role, he was responsible for overseeing the U.S. intelligence community and providing the President with critical intelligence assessments and briefings. Ratcliffe’s tenure was marked by a focus on counterintelligence and national security threats, particularly from China and Russia. He played a key role in supporting Trump’s agenda to confront and challenge these geopolitical rivals, including efforts to strengthen the U.S. Space Force’s integration into the intelligence framework. Ratcliffe’s alignment with Trump’s priorities was evident in his emphasis on cybersecurity and counterterrorism, as well as his support for the President’s approach to intelligence and national security.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
