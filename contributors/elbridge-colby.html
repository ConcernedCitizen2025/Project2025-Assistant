<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Force Development</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Elbridge Colby served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Force Development during the Trump administration, where he was a principal architect of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. This strategy emphasized a shift towards great power competition, particularly with China and Russia, marking a significant change in U.S. defense policy. Colby has a strong background in national security and defense, having previously held positions at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. He holds a JD from Yale Law School and a BA from Harvard University. Colby is also the co-founder of The Marathon Initiative, a think tank focused on preparing the U.S. for sustained great power competition.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Colby’s role in developing the National Defense Strategy placed him at the core of the Trump administration’s defense policy. His work was instrumental in pivoting U.S. defense priorities towards countering the strategic threats posed by China and Russia, aligning closely with Trump’s emphasis on military preparedness and a more confrontational stance against these nations.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
While Colby has not been involved in any personal scandals, his strategic focus on great power competition has sparked significant debate within the defense community. Critics argue that this approach could heighten tensions and lead to an arms race, particularly with China. Colby has also been a vocal critic of U.S. involvement in Ukraine, advocating instead for prioritizing military resources and strategic planning towards a potential conflict with China, particularly over Taiwan. His positions have garnered support among some GOP members but have also attracted scrutiny for their implications on U.S. foreign policy and defense spending.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Colby’s advocacy for a defense strategy centered on preparing for conflict with China, including a focus on Taiwan as a potential flashpoint, could lead to increased geopolitical tensions. His emphasis on reallocating resources away from Europe towards Asia has also been controversial, with concerns that this could undermine NATO and U.S. commitments to European security.</p>
