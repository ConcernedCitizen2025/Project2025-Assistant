<center><a href="/project2025_analyzing_the_threat.html" style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold;">Project 2025: <em><strong>Analyzing the Threat</strong></em></a></center>
In this section, I've organized the analysis of Project 2025 according to the subsections outlined in the document's table of contents. Each subsection includes two helpful logos: one in the upper left labeled "Red Flags in the Reforms" and one in the upper right labeled "In a Nutshell." These logos serve as shortcuts to their respective sections, allowing you to quickly access specific content without having to scroll through the entire analysis. The "Red Flags" section features direct quotes from the original document, while the "In a Nutshell" section provides a concise summary of the analysis. I encourage you to explore the full analysis if you have the time, but the shortcuts can be a useful tool for a quicker review.

    Demystifying Project 2025: <em>Probing Questions</em>
  </a>
</div>
The probing questions aim to uncover the implications of the proposals within Project 2025. These questions are organized into categories, with a final category labeled “All Questions” for those who wish to view them collectively. This organization is designed to help you find specific information more efficiently, though I encourage a more thorough exploration if time permits. When you click on a question, you’ll find a shortcut button in the upper right-hand corner labeled “In a Nutshell.” This button allows you to quickly access a summary of the analysis for that question.

The "Authors and Contributors" section provides a thorough list of the individuals involved in the creation of Project 2025, including authors, editors, and other contributors. Controversy has arisen over potential affiliations between these individuals and the Republican presidential nominee. Any such connections are noted next to the names on the list.
