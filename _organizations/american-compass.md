## Leadership and Influence
- **Oren Cass:** Founder and Executive Director of American Compass, Cass is a prominent conservative policy analyst known for his critiques of neoliberal economic policies and advocacy for a worker-centric economic approach.

## Connections to Trump
American Compass has ties to broader conservative movements, including affiliations with figures from the Trump administration. The organization's focus on reshaping economic policies and addressing the failures of globalization aligns with the economic agenda promoted by Trump and his supporters. Although Cass has critiqued some aspects of the Trump administration, particularly its execution of certain policies, he acknowledges that Trump's presidency marked a shift in the Republican Party's economic priorities ([American Compass](https://americancompass.org), [The American Conservative](https://amconrightnow.libsyn.com)).

## Concerns
- **Potential Bias:** The organization's strong conservative stance may influence the objectivity of its research and policy recommendations, prioritizing ideological consistency over balanced analysis. This has led to debates within conservative circles about the implications of its critiques of free-market policies ([American Compass](https://americancompass.org), [New York Magazine](https://nymag.com)).
- **Controversial Positions:** American Compass's critiques of free-market policies and globalization have sparked debate within conservative circles, highlighting tensions between traditional economic orthodoxy and emerging populist sentiments. These positions have made the organization a focal point for discussions about the future of conservative economic policy ([Politico](https://www.politico.com), [The American Conservative](https://amconrightnow.libsyn.com)).

## Conclusion
American Compass is a significant voice in the conservative economic policy debate, advocating for reforms that prioritize workers, families, and national industry. Its focus on rethinking traditional economic policies and promoting conservative values makes it a key player in shaping future conservative agendas.
