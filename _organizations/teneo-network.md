# Teneo Network

## Overview
The Teneo Network is a conservative organization founded to create and sustain a network of influential leaders committed to conservative principles. Established in 2008 by Evan Baehr and others, Teneo's mission is to recruit, connect, and deploy talented conservatives to lead opinion and shape the industries that influence society. The organization is dedicated to promoting conservative values across American politics and culture, positioning itself as a counterweight to perceived liberal dominance in key sectors ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org), [CT Mirror](https://www.ctmirror.org)).

## Mission and Activities
Teneoâ€™s mission is to reaffirm and renew the promise of the American experiment through its network of influential leaders. Key activities include:
- **Recruitment and Training:** Teneo focuses on identifying and preparing conservatives for leadership roles in politics, business, media, and other influential sectors. This includes fostering connections and facilitating strategic projects that advance conservative goals ([Bradley Impact Fund](https://www.bradleyimpactfund.org), [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org)).
- **Annual Retreats and Regional Meetups:** The organization hosts events that bring together members and allies to foster connections and develop strategic initiatives. These gatherings are crucial for building the "foxhole" relationships that underpin Teneo's approach to conservative activism ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org)).
- **Policy Influence:** Teneo engages in public advocacy and strategic projects aimed at rolling back liberal influence in key industries, working to ensure that conservative voices are heard in boardrooms, media outlets, and other critical arenas ([CT Mirror](https://www.ctmirror.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Evan Baehr:** Founder and former CEO, Baehr is a tech entrepreneur and veteran conservative activist with a background in policy and business. He played a key role in establishing Teneo as a network designed to rival the influence of liberal institutions ([Portside](https://www.portside.org)).
- **Amanda Covo:** Current CEO, Covo previously served as the group's director of communications. She emphasizes the network's role in placing conservatives in influential positions across key industries, reflecting Teneo's broad strategic goals ([Bradley Impact Fund](https://www.bradleyimpactfund.org)).
- **Leonard Leo:** Chairman since 2021, Leo is known for his significant influence within the conservative legal movement, particularly through his work with the Federalist Society and his role in advising President Trump on judicial appointments. His leadership has significantly expanded Teneo's influence and financial backing ([NY Progressive Action Network](https://www.nypan.org)).

## Connections to Trump
Teneo has deep connections to the Trump administration. Many of its members held significant positions within the Trump White House, State Department, Justice Department, and Pentagon. Leonard Leo, who was instrumental in shaping the Supreme Court's conservative majority, has played a key role in expanding Teneo's influence within conservative circles, including those linked to Trump ([CT Mirror](https://www.ctmirror.org), [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** Teneo's strong conservative stance and its mission to "crush liberal dominance" may raise concerns about the organization's objectivity and the inclusivity of its approach to policy and leadership development ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org)).
- **Financial Influence:** The organization's significant funding from conservative donors, including DonorsTrust and other high-profile conservative foundations, suggests a concentrated influence from a small group of ideological backers, raising questions about the broader implications of its agenda ([NY Progressive Action Network](https://www.nypan.org)).

## Conclusion
The Teneo Network is a powerful conservative organization focused on shaping American politics and culture through strategic leadership development and policy advocacy. Its strong connections to the Trump administration and influential conservative figures underscore its significant role in the conservative movement. However, its political bias and the concentrated nature of its funding necessitate careful consideration of its activities and influence ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org), [Bradley Impact Fund](https://www.bradleyimpactfund.org)).
