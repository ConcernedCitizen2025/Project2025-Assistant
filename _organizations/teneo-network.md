# Teneo Network

## Overview
The Teneo Network is a conservative organization founded in 2008, designed to create a network of influential leaders committed to advancing conservative principles across American politics and culture. Initially struggling to gain traction, Teneo grew significantly under the guidance of Leonard Leo, a key figure in the conservative legal movement. The organization now plays a pivotal role in promoting conservative values and aims to counter liberal influence in key sectors, such as media, finance, and law.

## Mission and Activities
Teneo’s mission is to recruit, connect, and deploy conservatives into leadership roles where they can influence public opinion and policy. Key activities include:
- **Leadership Development:** Teneo identifies and trains conservatives for influential positions across politics, media, business, and other critical sectors.
- **Networking Events:** The organization hosts annual retreats and regional meetups, facilitating connections among members and fostering collaboration on conservative initiatives.
- **Strategic Influence:** Teneo engages in public advocacy and strategic projects aimed at curbing liberal dominance in various industries, particularly through initiatives focused on media, corporate America, and law.

## Leadership and Influence
- **[Evan Baehr](https://www.monitoringinfluence.org/org/teneo-network/):** Co-founder of Teneo, Baehr played a crucial role in establishing the network, which he modeled after the Federalist Society.
- **[Leonard Leo](https://www.propublica.org/article/we-dont-talk-about-leonard-leo-supreme-court-supermajority):** Chairman since 2021, Leo has significantly expanded Teneo’s influence and financial backing, leveraging his connections within the conservative movement.
- **[Amanda Covo](https://events.heritage.org/rbtesting/chalktalkspeakers):** Current CEO, Covo emphasizes placing conservatives in leadership roles across key industries to further Teneo's mission.

## Connections to Trump
Teneo Network has deep connections to the Trump administration, particularly through Leonard Leo, who advised Trump on judicial appointments. Many Teneo members held significant roles within the Trump White House and other federal agencies, and the network continues to support individuals aligned with Trump's conservative agenda.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** Teneo’s strong conservative stance and its mission to combat liberal influence may raise concerns about the organization’s objectivity and inclusivity.
- **Financial Influence:** The organization’s funding from conservative donors, including DonorsTrust and other influential foundations, suggests a concentrated ideological influence, which could affect its broader impact on policy and culture.

## Conclusion
The Teneo Network is a powerful force within the conservative movement, shaping American politics and culture through leadership development and strategic advocacy. Its strong ties to the Trump administration and influential conservative figures highlight its significant role, but its political bias and financial backing warrant careful scrutiny of its activities and influence.
