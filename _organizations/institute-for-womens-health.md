# Institute for Women's Health (IWH)

## Overview
The Institute for Women's Health (IWH) is a nonprofit organization headquartered in Washington, D.C., dedicated to promoting optimal health for women across all stages of life. Founded by Valerie Huber, IWH engages in both domestic and international initiatives to build coalitions that support women's health by addressing critical health issues through targeted actions and alliances. The organization is particularly known for its work in advocating for pro-family and pro-life policies on a global scale ([IWH](https://www.theiwh.org), [Philanthropy Roundtable](https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org)).

## Mission and Activities
IWH's mission is to advocate for the health and well-being of women globally by removing barriers to healthcare access and fostering collaboration among governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders. Key activities include:
- **Coalition Building:** IWH collaborates with a wide range of partners, including governments and NGOs, to enhance women's access to healthcare and improve health outcomes globally. The organization also plays a significant role in promoting the Geneva Consensus Declaration (GCD), which aligns with its pro-life and pro-family values ([IWH](https://www.theiwh.org)).
- **Educational Outreach:** The organization provides resources and information to educate the public and policymakers about women's health issues, with a focus on non-controversial, widely accepted health practices ([IWH](https://www.theiwh.org)).
- **Policy Advocacy:** IWH works to influence health policies that support women's health and address disparities, often aligning with conservative health policy initiatives ([IWH](https://www.theiwh.org), [Philanthropy Roundtable](https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Valerie Huber, M.Ed.:** Founder and President of IWH. Huber has an extensive background in global women's health and has held significant positions in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including Special Representative for Global Women's Health. She has been instrumental in promoting health outcomes for women, particularly through the Geneva Consensus Declaration ([IWH](https://www.theiwh.org)).
- **Dr. Alma Golden:** Chief Operating Officer (COO). Dr. Golden has extensive experience in healthcare policy, having served as the Assistant Administrator for the Bureau for Global Health at USAID and other key roles under the Bush administration. Her work focuses on improving health outcomes for women globally ([IWH](https://www.theiwh.org)).
- **Victoria Akyea, M.P.H.:** Executive Management Director. Akyea is a public health professional currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Health Sciences. She manages IWH's operations and contributes to its strategic initiatives ([IWH](https://www.theiwh.org)).

## Connections to Trump
IWH has connections to the Trump administration, particularly through Valerie Huber's and Dr. Alma Golden's previous roles in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These connections reflect IWH's alignment with conservative health policy initiatives, especially those related to women's health and reproductive issues ([IWH](https://www.theiwh.org), [Philanthropy Roundtable](https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org)).

## Concerns
- **Potential Political Bias:** IWHâ€™s strong ties to conservative figures and its focus on pro-family and pro-life issues may raise concerns about potential biases in its advocacy and policy recommendations. Critics argue that these positions could limit the organization's inclusivity and objectivity in addressing broader women's health issues ([IWH](https://www.theiwh.org)).

## Conclusion
The Institute for Women's Health is a significant player in promoting women's health through coalition-building, policy advocacy, and educational outreach. Its strong leadership and connections to conservative health policy initiatives highlight its influence and commitment to improving health outcomes for women globally. However, the potential for political bias necessitates a careful examination of its advocacy efforts and policy recommendations ([IWH](https://www.theiwh.org), [Philanthropy Roundtable](https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org)).
