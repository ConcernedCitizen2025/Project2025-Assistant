# Pacific Research Institute (PRI)

## Overview
The Pacific Research Institute (PRI) is a California-based free-market think tank founded in 1979 by British philanthropist Antony Fisher and San Francisco businessman James North. The organization promotes the principles of individual freedom, personal responsibility, and limited government. PRI conducts research and advocacy on various policy issues, including healthcare, education, the environment, and economic policy, emphasizing free-market solutions ([Pacific Research Institute](https://www.pacificresearch.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Research_Institute)).

## Mission and Activities
PRI's mission is to champion freedom, opportunity, and personal responsibility through free-market policy solutions. Key activities include:
- **Research and Publications:** PRI produces reports, studies, and books on various policy issues, advocating market-based solutions. Topics include healthcare reform, education policy, environmental regulations, and economic policies ([Pacific Research Institute](https://www.pacificresearch.org), [RootsHQ](https://www.rootshq.com)).
- **Public Advocacy:** The institute engages in public advocacy, legislative testimony, and community outreach to promote its policy recommendations. It also operates several focused centers, such as the Center for Health Care and the Center for Education ([Pacific Research Institute](https://www.pacificresearch.org)).
- **Project 21:** PRI is involved in initiatives like Project 21, a network of African-American conservative leaders who provide perspectives on public policy issues ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Sally C. Pipes:** President and CEO, Pipes has led PRI since 1991 and is a prominent advocate for free-market healthcare solutions. She is known for her opposition to single-payer healthcare systems and has been a vocal critic of policies like Obamacare and Medicare for All ([Pacific Research Institute](https://www.pacificresearch.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Research_Institute)).
- **Lance T. Izumi:** Senior Director of the Center for Education, Izumi has extensive experience in education policy and served on President Trump's transition team for education. He is an author and producer of works on educational reform ([Pacific Research Institute](https://www.pacificresearch.org)).
- **Rowena M. Itchon:** Chief Operating Officer, Itchon oversees research, marketing, and operations at PRI, bringing a strong background in public policy and media relations ([Pacific Research Institute](https://www.pacificresearch.org)).

## Connections to Trump
PRI has significant connections to the Trump administration, particularly through Lance Izumi's role on Trump's transition team for education policy. The institute's advocacy for deregulation and free-market principles aligns with many of Trump's policies. PRI is also a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative aimed at shaping conservative policy for future Republican administrations ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Research_Institute)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** PRI is rated as right-center biased and mostly factual in its reporting. Its strong emphasis on free-market solutions and conservative policy stances may affect the objectivity of its research and recommendations ([Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com)).
- **Controversial Stances:** PRI has been involved in debates over climate change policy, often opposing the scientific consensus on human-influenced climate change. This position has been a point of contention among critics ([Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com)).

## Conclusion
The Pacific Research Institute is a significant player in promoting free-market principles and conservative policies. Its research and advocacy efforts influence public policy debates, particularly in California. However, its ideological stance and connections to conservative movements, including the Trump administration, warrant careful consideration of its policy recommendations and research outputs ([Pacific Research Institute](https://www.pacificresearch.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Research_Institute)).
