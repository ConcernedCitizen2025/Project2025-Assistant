# American Moment

## Overview
American Moment is a nonprofit organization founded in 2021 by Saurabh Sharma, Nick Solheim, and Jake Mercier. The organization is dedicated to reshaping the political class to reflect populist priorities by identifying, educating, and credentialing young Americans who will implement public policy supporting strong families, national sovereignty, and economic prosperity. American Moment has quickly become a significant force within the conservative movement, particularly in preparing the next generation of leaders for potential future Republican administrations.

## Mission and Activities
American Moment's mission centers on building a new political elite aligned with populist conservative values. Key activities include:
- **Policy Advocacy:** The organization promotes policies that support strong families, national sovereignty, and economic prosperity. Their focus includes law and order, restrictive immigration policies, and curtailing the influence of multinational corporations.
- **Training Programs:** American Moment runs programs like the Fellowship for American Statecraft, which trains and places young conservatives in government and public policy roles, ensuring they are equipped to advance populist conservative agendas.
- **Public Engagement:** Through podcasts, articles, media appearances, and events, American Moment aims to shape public policy and opinion. Their podcast, *Moment of Truth*, provides insights into the populist right's political landscape, featuring discussions with prominent conservative thinkers.

## Connections to Trump
American Moment is closely connected to the broader MAGA movement. The organization is actively involved in Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative aimed at staffing a future conservative administration. American Moment’s advisory board includes influential conservatives like J.D. Vance and Josh Hammer, indicating strong ties to key figures within the Trump-aligned populist movement. The group’s training programs are also designed to prepare young conservatives to staff the next Republican administration, particularly if led by Trump or a similar figure.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** American Moment’s research and policy recommendations are heavily influenced by its populist conservative ideology, which may impact the objectivity of its analysis and proposals.
- **Controversial Policy Positions:** The organization’s stance on issues like immigration, economic regulation, and its involvement in initiatives like Project 2025 has sparked debate. Critics argue that these positions could lead to significant changes in governance that may not reflect a broad consensus within the conservative movement.

## Conclusion
American Moment plays a pivotal role in promoting populist conservative values and preparing the future political class. While its mission resonates with a segment of the American populace, the potential social and ethical implications of its policy proposals and training programs warrant careful scrutiny.
