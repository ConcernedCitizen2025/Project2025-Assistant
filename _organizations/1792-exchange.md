# 1792 Exchange

## Overview
The 1792 Exchange is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization committed to protecting free exercise, free speech, and free enterprise by exposing corporate activism and promoting ideological neutrality in businesses. The organization is known for its "Spotlight Bias Reports," which assess companies on their likelihood to engage in politically motivated actions that could impact consumers and shareholders. The 1792 Exchange has become a significant player in the conservative movement, particularly in its efforts to counteract "woke" corporate practices and the influence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria ([New York Post](https://nypost.com/2023/07/18/1792-exchange-aims-to-counter-woke-corporations-with-new-report)).

## Mission and Activities
The 1792 Exchange's mission is to restore ideological neutrality within businesses. Key activities include:
- **Corporate Bias Reports:** Publishing reports that evaluate over 2,500 companies on their likelihood to cancel contracts, boycott, or deny services based on ideological beliefs. These reports aim to help businesses and consumers understand potential risks associated with corporate activism ([Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/new-report-rates-companies-bias-against-conservatives)).
- **Educational Resources:** Providing resources to educate citizens, lawmakers, and organizations about corporate activism and its potential violations of fiduciary duties. The organization also highlights the risks associated with ESG policies, arguing that these can lead to decisions that prioritize political agendas over shareholder returns ([Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/1792-exchange-urges-businesses-to-ditch-political-agendas)).
- **Advocacy:** The 1792 Exchange advocates for businesses to avoid engaging in divisive political stances, encouraging a return to focusing on their core mission of delivering quality products and services ([Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/1792-exchange-urges-businesses-to-ditch-political-agendas)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Daniel Cameron:** CEO of 1792 Exchange. Cameron, who previously served as the Attorney General of Kentucky, brings a strong background in legal and policy advocacy. His leadership focuses on protecting freedoms and steering companies away from divisive political engagements. Cameron's tenure as Attorney General included a multi-state investigation into ESG-related investment practices, which aligns with the 1792 Exchange's mission ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/03/kentucky-ag-cameron-to-lead-1792-exchange-00075980)).
- **Paul Fitzpatrick:** President of 1792 Exchange. Fitzpatrick has emphasized the organization's commitment to ensuring that Americans can conduct business without fear of being canceled for their religious or ideological beliefs. His leadership supports the organization's broader efforts to promote accountability and neutrality in corporate America ([Christian Post](https://www.christianpost.com/news/1792-exchange-ceo-warns-of-woke-capitalism.html)).

## Connections to Trump
While the 1792 Exchange does not have direct ties to the Trump administration, its mission aligns with broader conservative agendas often associated with Trump's policies. The organization’s focus on counteracting progressive corporate practices and protecting religious freedoms resonates strongly with conservative principles that were central to the Trump administration's approach to governance ([National Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/01/corporate-neutrality-in-the-woke-era)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** The 1792 Exchange’s strong stance against corporate activism and promotion of ideological neutrality might be perceived as biased against progressive policies, which could affect the perceived objectivity of its reports and advocacy efforts ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-conservatives-are-pushing-back-against-corporate-america-2023-5)).
- **Impact on Corporate Practices:** The organization's efforts to rate and expose companies based on their political and ideological stances could lead to increased polarization within the corporate environment. This approach may influence companies to either adopt more extreme positions or become more secretive about their policies to avoid scrutiny ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherrenner/2023/06/01/the-risk-of-esg-backlash-how-companies-should-respond)).

## Conclusion
The 1792 Exchange is a key player in the conservative movement's efforts to promote free enterprise and protect ideological freedoms within the corporate world. Through its reports and advocacy, the organization seeks to foster an environment where businesses can operate without political bias. However, the 1792 Exchange's methods and goals, while aligned with conservative values, could contribute to increased polarization in corporate governance, raising important questions about the long-term implications for the balance of political power in the business sector.
