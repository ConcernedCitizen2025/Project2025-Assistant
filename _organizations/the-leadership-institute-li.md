# The Leadership Institute (LI)

## Overview
The Leadership Institute (LI) is a nonpartisan educational organization founded in 1979 by conservative activist Morton C. Blackwell. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, LI is dedicated to increasing the number and effectiveness of conservative activists and leaders in the public policy process. The institute offers a wide range of training programs aimed at equipping conservatives with the skills needed to influence public policy, media, and government. Over the years, LI has trained tens of thousands of individuals, many of whom have gone on to hold significant positions in politics, government, and media ([Leadership Institute](https://www.leadershipinstitute.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leadership_Institute)).

## Mission and Activities
LI’s mission is to identify, train, recruit, and place conservatives in politics, government, and media. Key activities include:
- **Training Programs:** LI offers over 50 types of training seminars, workshops, and schools that cover topics like campaign management, fundraising, grassroots organizing, public speaking, and media relations. These programs are conducted at LI’s Arlington headquarters, across the United States, and occasionally internationally ([Leadership Institute](https://www.leadershipinstitute.org)).
- **Campus Reform:** LI runs the news website Campus Reform, which focuses on exposing what it perceives as liberal bias on college campuses. This platform trains and supports conservative student journalists and investigators who report on incidents of alleged liberal bias in higher education ([Leadership Institute](https://www.leadershipinstitute.org), [Campus Reform](https://www.campusreform.org)).
- **Employment Placement:** LI provides resources like ConservativeJobs.com to help place trained conservatives in influential public policy positions and media roles. This service connects job seekers with employers at no cost ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leadership_Institute)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Morton C. Blackwell:** Founder and President, Blackwell has been a prominent figure in conservative politics for decades, offering training and resources to generations of conservative activists. His leadership has been instrumental in establishing LI as a central hub for conservative training ([Leadership Institute](https://www.leadershipinstitute.org)).
- **David Fenner:** Executive Vice President, Fenner oversees daily operations and strategic initiatives at LI, ensuring the smooth execution of the institute’s extensive training programs ([Leadership Institute](https://www.leadershipinstitute.org)).
- **Colleen Bohannon:** Director of Programs, Bohannon manages LI’s various training programs, ensuring they meet the institute’s educational goals and effectively equip participants with practical skills ([Leadership Institute](https://www.leadershipinstitute.org)).

## Connections to Trump
LI has significant connections to the Trump administration and broader conservative movements. It is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative aimed at shaping conservative policy for future Republican administrations. This involvement underscores LI's role in preparing conservatives to take on leadership roles in a potential second Trump administration, with an emphasis on implementing conservative policies at all levels of government ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leadership_Institute), [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** LI’s strong focus on training conservative activists and its close ties to right-wing movements may raise concerns about the diversity of perspectives presented in its programs. Critics argue that its emphasis on conservative principles could limit exposure to a broader range of viewpoints ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leadership_Institute)).
- **Influence on Policy:** The institute’s role in shaping and placing conservative leaders in key positions raises questions about the impact of its training on public policy and governance. The potential for these leaders to prioritize ideological goals over public interest is a significant concern ([Leadership Institute](https://www.leadershipinstitute.org)).

## Conclusion
The Leadership Institute is a pivotal organization in training and equipping conservative leaders in the United States. Its comprehensive training programs and strategic initiatives have significantly influenced conservative policy and activism. However, its strong ideological focus and connections to conservative movements warrant careful consideration of its impact on political diversity and public policy ([Leadership Institute](https://www.leadershipinstitute.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leadership_Institute)).
