# The Leadership Institute (LI)

## Overview
The Leadership Institute (LI), founded in 1979 by conservative activist Morton C. Blackwell, is a prominent educational organization based in Arlington, Virginia. It focuses on increasing the number and effectiveness of conservative activists and leaders in public policy, media, and government. LI offers a broad array of training programs designed to equip conservatives with skills necessary for influencing public policy and media. Over the years, it has trained numerous individuals who have gone on to hold influential positions across various sectors.

## Mission and Activities
LI’s mission is to identify, train, recruit, and place conservatives in politics, government, and media. Key activities include:
- **Training Programs:** Offering more than 50 types of training seminars, workshops, and schools on topics such as campaign management, fundraising, grassroots organizing, public speaking, and media relations. These programs are held at LI’s headquarters in Arlington, across the U.S., and occasionally internationally.
- **Campus Reform:** Operating the news website Campus Reform, which targets what it views as liberal bias on college campuses. The platform supports conservative student journalists and investigators who report on incidents of alleged liberal bias in higher education.
- **Employment Placement:** Providing resources like ConservativeJobs.com to help place trained conservatives in influential public policy positions and media roles. This service connects job seekers with employers at no cost.

## Connections to Trump
The Leadership Institute has notable connections to the Trump administration and broader conservative movements. It is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a plan aimed at reshaping the federal government under a potential second Trump presidency. However, Trump himself has denied direct involvement with Project 2025 and has distanced his campaign from it despite previously supporting the Heritage Foundation and its influence on conservative policies&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** As a conservative organization, LI’s programs and publications may reflect a strong ideological bias, raising questions about the objectivity of its training and reporting.
- **Influence on Politics:** The institute's extensive network and training programs may contribute to increasing partisan polarization by promoting conservative agendas and candidates.
