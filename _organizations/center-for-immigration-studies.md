# Center for Immigration Studies

## Overview
The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) is a nonprofit research organization founded in 1985, known for advocating lower immigration levels and stricter enforcement policies in the United States. CIS is a key player in the immigration policy debate, often providing research and policy recommendations that align with a reduction in immigration. The organization has been influential in shaping public discourse and immigration policy, particularly during the Trump administration ([CIS](https://cis.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Immigration_Studies)).

## Mission and Activities
CIS's mission is to provide reliable information about the social, economic, environmental, security, and fiscal consequences of legal and illegal immigration into the United States. Key activities include:
- **Research:** CIS conducts studies and publishes reports on various aspects of immigration policy, including border security, visa programs, and the impact of immigration on the labor market. These studies are often used to advocate for reduced immigration levels ([CIS](https://cis.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Immigration_Studies)).
- **Public Policy Advocacy:** The organization engages with policymakers and the public to advocate for policies that reduce immigration levels and enhance enforcement measures. CIS's advocacy has been particularly influential during the Trump administration, where its research was frequently cited ([Bridge Initiative](https://bridge.georgetown.edu)).
- **Media Engagement:** CIS provides expert commentary and analysis on immigration issues through media appearances and publications, contributing to the national conversation on immigration ([CIS](https://cis.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Mark Krikorian:** As Executive Director of CIS, Krikorian is a prominent voice in the immigration debate, advocating for reduced immigration levels and stricter enforcement policies. He has been instrumental in shaping the organization's direction and influence, particularly during the Trump administration ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Immigration_Studies), [Ideaspace](https://www.ideaspace.com)).
- **Steven A. Camarota:** Director of Research, Camarota conducts studies on the impact of immigration on the U.S. labor market and social services. His research is a cornerstone of CIS's policy recommendations ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Immigration_Studies)).

## Connections to Trump
CIS has had significant influence on the Trump administration's immigration policies. The organization's research and recommendations closely aligned with the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, including the emphasis on border security and reduced immigration levels. CIS played a major consulting role during Trump’s 2016 campaign and continued to influence policy throughout his presidency ([Ideaspace](https://www.ideaspace.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Immigration_Studies)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** CIS's strong stance on reducing immigration levels has led to criticism from pro-immigration groups and organizations advocating for immigrant rights. Critics argue that CIS's research and advocacy are influenced by an anti-immigration bias, which may affect the objectivity of its findings ([Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org), [Plot Against Immigrants](https://www.plotagainstimmigrants.com)).
- **Controversial Positions:** CIS has been involved in contentious debates over immigration policy, with some of its positions being criticized for fostering negative perceptions of immigrants. The organization has also been linked to individuals and groups that promote white nationalist views, which has further fueled controversy ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Immigration_Studies), [Bridge Initiative](https://bridge.georgetown.edu)).

## Conclusion
The Center for Immigration Studies plays a significant role in the immigration policy debate in the United States. Its research and advocacy efforts have influenced public discourse and policy decisions, particularly during the Trump administration. However, its strong stance on reducing immigration and associated controversies warrant careful consideration of its research and recommendations ([CIS](https://cis.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Immigration_Studies)).
