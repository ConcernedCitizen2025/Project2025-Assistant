# Center for Immigration Studies

## Overview
The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) is a nonprofit research organization founded in 1985, known for advocating lower immigration levels and stricter enforcement policies in the United States. CIS is a prominent player in the immigration policy debate, providing research and policy recommendations that support reducing immigration. The organization has been influential in shaping public discourse and immigration policy, particularly during the Trump administration.

## Mission and Activities
CIS's mission is to provide reliable information about the social, economic, environmental, security, and fiscal impacts of legal and illegal immigration in the United States. Key activities include:
- **Research:** CIS conducts studies on various aspects of immigration policy, including border security, visa programs, and the impact of immigration on the labor market. These studies often support the organization's stance on reducing immigration levels.
- **Public Policy Advocacy:** CIS engages with policymakers and the public to advocate for policies that reduce immigration and strengthen enforcement measures. The organization’s research was frequently cited during the Trump administration.
- **Media Engagement:** CIS provides expert commentary on immigration issues through media appearances and publications, influencing the national conversation on immigration.

## Leadership and Influence
- **Mark Krikorian:** As Executive Director of CIS, Krikorian is a central figure in the immigration debate, advocating for reduced immigration and stricter enforcement. His leadership has been pivotal in shaping the organization's direction and influence, particularly during the Trump era.
- **Steven A. Camarota:** Director of Research, Camarota is known for his studies on the impact of immigration on U.S. labor markets and social services, forming the foundation of CIS's policy recommendations.

## Connections to Trump
CIS had significant influence on the Trump administration's immigration policies. The organization’s research and recommendations aligned closely with Trump’s immigration agenda, emphasizing border security and reducing immigration levels. CIS played a consulting role during Trump’s 2016 campaign and continued to influence policy throughout his presidency. Despite this alignment, Krikorian himself expressed skepticism about Trump, referring to him as a "bloviating megalomaniac" before later supporting the administration’s policies.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** CIS's strong stance on reducing immigration has drawn criticism from pro-immigration groups, who argue that the organization’s research is influenced by an anti-immigration bias. Critics also point to connections between CIS and individuals or groups promoting white nationalist views, which has fueled controversy.
- **Controversial Positions:** CIS has been involved in contentious debates over immigration policy, with some positions criticized for fostering negative perceptions of immigrants. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has designated CIS as a hate group, a label that CIS disputes, arguing that it is based on disagreement with its policy positions rather than any promotion of hate.

## Conclusion
The Center for Immigration Studies is a major force in the immigration policy debate in the U.S., with a significant impact on public discourse and policy, especially during the Trump administration. However, its strong stance on reducing immigration and the controversies surrounding its positions and associations warrant careful scrutiny of its research and recommendations.
