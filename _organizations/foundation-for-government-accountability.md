# Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA)

## Overview
The Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) is a conservative public policy think tank founded in 2011 by Tarren Bragdon. Based in Naples, Florida, FGA focuses on promoting free-market solutions in welfare, healthcare, and workforce policy. The organization aims to reduce government dependency and foster economic growth by advocating for welfare reform, opposing Medicaid expansion, and influencing labor laws. FGA has become influential in shaping state and national policies through research, advocacy, and partnerships with key conservative figures and organizations ([FGA](https://thefga.org), [SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org)).

## Mission and Activities
FGA's mission is to advance policies that reduce government dependency and promote economic freedom. Key activities include:
- **Policy Advocacy:** FGA is actively involved in promoting welfare reform, blocking Medicaid expansion, and pushing for changes to labor laws that favor free-market principles. The organization has been instrumental in advancing state legislation that reduces welfare benefits and increases work requirements ([FGA](https://thefga.org), [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org)).
- **Research and Education:** FGA produces research and reports that influence public policy and inform legislators. The organization's work often supports conservative approaches to healthcare and welfare, arguing for reduced government intervention ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org), [SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org)).
- **Litigation:** FGA files amicus briefs in key Supreme Court cases, advocating for conservative interpretations of the law, particularly in areas related to healthcare and government spending ([Monitoring Influence](https://www.monitoringinfluence.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Tarren Bragdon:** Founder and CEO, Bragdon has a background in public policy and has been a significant voice in conservative advocacy. His leadership has expanded FGAâ€™s influence across multiple states and in federal policy discussions ([FGA](https://thefga.org), [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org)).
- **Jonathan Ingram:** Vice President of Policy and Research, Ingram leads the development of policy solutions that emphasize work over welfare and oppose Medicaid expansion ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).

## Connections to Trump
FGA has aligned closely with the Trump administration, particularly in efforts to roll back Medicaid expansion and implement welfare reforms. The organization's advocacy aligns with Trump's broader agenda of reducing federal oversight and promoting state-level decision-making in welfare and healthcare ([SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** FGA has been criticized for promoting policies that may disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as opposing Medicaid expansion and pushing for stringent welfare reforms ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), [Bradley Impact Fund](https://www.bradleyimpactfund.org)).
- **Policy Impact:** The organization's advocacy for changes in welfare and labor laws, such as reducing restrictions on teenage workers, has faced opposition for potentially increasing exploitation and poverty ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org), [SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org)).

## Conclusion
The Foundation for Government Accountability is a key player in conservative policy advocacy, focusing on reducing government dependency and promoting free-market principles. While its efforts have led to significant policy changes, particularly in welfare reform, the potential social and economic impacts of its recommendations warrant careful consideration and balanced analysis ([FGA](https://thefga.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org)).
