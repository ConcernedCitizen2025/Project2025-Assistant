# Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA)

## Overview
The Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) is a conservative public policy think tank founded in 2011 by Tarren Bragdon and based in Naples, Florida. FGA focuses on promoting free-market solutions in welfare, healthcare, and workforce policy. The organization is dedicated to reducing government dependency and fostering economic growth through advocacy, research, and litigation. FGA has become influential in shaping state and national policies, particularly in welfare reform, opposing Medicaid expansion, and labor law adjustments.

## Mission and Activities
FGA's mission is to advance policies that reduce government dependency and promote economic freedom. Key activities include:
- **Policy Advocacy:** FGA actively promotes welfare reform, opposes Medicaid expansion, and pushes for labor law changes that align with free-market principles. The organization has been pivotal in advancing state legislation that reduces welfare benefits and increases work requirements.
- **Research and Education:** FGA produces research and reports that support conservative approaches to healthcare and welfare, arguing for reduced government intervention. These reports are used to influence policymakers and inform public debates.
- **Litigation:** FGA files amicus briefs in key Supreme Court cases and engages in legal advocacy, particularly focusing on conservative interpretations of the law in areas like healthcare and government spending.

## Leadership and Influence
- **Tarren Bragdon:** Founder and CEO, Bragdon is a significant figure in conservative policy advocacy. Under his leadership, FGA has expanded its influence across multiple states and federal policy discussions, with a strong focus on welfare reform and reducing government dependency.
- **Jonathan Ingram:** Vice President of Policy and Research, Ingram oversees the development of policy solutions that emphasize work over welfare and resist Medicaid expansion. His work is central to FGA’s policy research and advocacy efforts.

## Connections to Trump
FGA has aligned closely with the Trump administration, particularly in efforts to roll back Medicaid expansion and implement welfare reforms. The organization's advocacy aligns with Trump's broader agenda of reducing federal oversight and promoting state-level decision-making in welfare and healthcare. FGA is also connected to Project 2025, an initiative supported by various conservative groups, including those aligned with Trump’s policies.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** FGA has faced criticism for promoting policies that may disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as its opposition to Medicaid expansion and stringent welfare reforms. Critics argue that these policies could increase poverty and reduce access to essential services.
- **Policy Impact:** The organization’s advocacy for reducing child labor protections and pushing for welfare reforms that impose strict work requirements has been controversial. Critics claim these policies could lead to increased exploitation and hardship among low-income families.

## Conclusion
The Foundation for Government Accountability is a key player in conservative policy advocacy, focusing on reducing government dependency and promoting free-market principles. While its efforts have led to significant policy changes, particularly in welfare reform, the potential social and economic impacts of its recommendations warrant careful scrutiny and balanced analysis.
