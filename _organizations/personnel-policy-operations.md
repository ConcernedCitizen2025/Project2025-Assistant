# Personnel Policy Operations (PPO)

## Overview
Personnel Policy Operations (PPO) is a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., established in 2022 to support conservative "America First" civil servants and their advisors. PPO operates under the principle that "personnel is policy," emphasizing the critical role of government personnel in shaping and implementing public policies. The organization is an IRS-approved 501(c)(3) public charity, closely aligned with conservative initiatives and the Trump administration’s agenda.

## Mission and Activities
PPO’s mission is to educate, train, and defend conservative public servants. Key activities include:
- **Training Programs:** PPO offers training for individuals interested in public service, focusing on best practices for effective government service.
- **Community Building:** The organization fosters a network among current and future officials, encouraging the exchange of knowledge and mutual support within conservative circles.
- **Legal Defense:** PPO operates the Courage Under Fire Legal Defense Fund, which provides legal support to individuals facing challenges due to their conservative views or involvement in politically contentious matters, particularly those related to the 2020 election.

## Leadership and Influence
- **[Troup Calhoun Hemenway](/contributors/troup-hemenway.html):** President of PPO, Hemenway has extensive experience in government, including serving in the Trump administration as Associate Director for National Security in the Office of Presidential Personnel. He is also involved with the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, further influencing conservative policy development.
- **[Joshua Whitehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Whitehouse):** Chief Operating Officer, Whitehouse has a long history in conservative politics, including service in the Trump administration and as an early endorser of Trump during his 2016 campaign.

## Connections to Trump
PPO has strong connections to the Trump administration, particularly through its legal defense efforts for former Trump officials and campaign members. The organization’s focus on defending "America First" personnel aligns with Trump's broader agenda. PPO's involvement in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 highlights its ongoing influence in preparing for potential future conservative administrations.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** PPO’s strong focus on defending conservative "America First" public servants may raise concerns about its objectivity, potentially promoting a narrow ideological perspective in its training and advocacy efforts.
- **Legal and Ethical Issues:** The organization's involvement in defending individuals linked to controversial claims about the 2020 election raises questions about its stance on legal and ethical standards in public service. The use of charitable funds for legal defenses related to politically charged issues has also attracted scrutiny.

## Conclusion
Personnel Policy Operations plays a significant role in supporting and defending conservative public servants. Its educational and legal defense efforts are crucial in enabling these individuals to advocate for their policies without undue hindrance. However, the organization's strong ideological focus and involvement in contentious legal battles necessitate careful consideration of its activities and impact.
