# Personnel Policy Operations (PPO)

## Overview
Personnel Policy Operations (PPO) is a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., dedicated to supporting conservative "America First" civil servants and their advisors. Founded in 2022, PPO operates under the principle that "personnel is policy," emphasizing the importance of personnel in shaping and implementing public policies. The organization is an IRS-approved section 501(c)(3) public charity and is closely aligned with conservative initiatives, especially those linked to the Trump administration ([Dallas Express](https://www.dallasexpress.com), [Hillsdale DC](https://dc.hillsdale.edu)).

## Mission and Activities
PPO’s mission is to educate, train, and defend conservative public servants. Key activities include:
- **Training Programs:** PPO provides training for individuals interested in public service, focusing on best practices and effective ways to serve in government positions ([Cause IQ](https://www.causeiq.com)).
- **Community Building:** The organization fosters a community among current and future officials to share knowledge and support each other in public service ([Personnel Policy Operations](https://www.personnelpolicyops.org)).
- **Legal Defense:** PPO operates the Courage Under Fire Legal Defense Fund, which offers legal support to individuals facing legal challenges due to their conservative views or involvement in contentious political matters, particularly those related to the 2020 election ([American Mind](https://americanmind.org), [Notus](https://www.notus.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Troup Calhoun Hemenway:** President of PPO, Hemenway has extensive experience in government, having served in the Trump administration as Associate Director for National Security in the Office of Presidential Personnel. He also plays a significant role in conservative networks through his involvement with the America First Policy Institute and Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 ([Hillsdale DC](https://dc.hillsdale.edu), [Dallas Express](https://www.dallasexpress.com)).
- **Joshua Whitehouse:** Chief Operating Officer, Whitehouse has been involved in conservative politics for years, including serving in the Trump administration and being the first elected official in New Hampshire to endorse Trump in 2015 ([Dallas Express](https://www.dallasexpress.com)).

## Connections to Trump
PPO has strong ties to the Trump administration, particularly through its legal defense efforts for former Trump officials and campaign members. The organization is involved in defending individuals who have faced legal challenges related to their actions during and after the 2020 election. PPO's alignment with Trump’s "America First" agenda is evident in its efforts to review and bring transparency to federal employees, ensuring they align with conservative values ([Notus](https://www.notus.org), [Dallas Express](https://www.dallasexpress.com)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** PPO's strong focus on defending conservative "America First" public servants may raise concerns about its objectivity and the balance of perspectives it promotes. Critics argue that this bias could influence its training and advocacy efforts, potentially favoring a particular ideological stance ([Cause IQ](https://www.causeiq.com)).
- **Legal and Ethical Issues:** The organization's involvement in defending individuals linked to controversial claims about the 2020 election could raise questions about its stance on legal and ethical standards in public service. PPO's role in providing legal aid to figures like Mark Meadows has been scrutinized, particularly regarding the use of charitable funds for such purposes ([Notus](https://www.notus.org)).

## Conclusion
Personnel Policy Operations plays a crucial role in supporting and defending conservative public servants. Its educational and legal defense efforts are pivotal in ensuring these individuals can advocate for their policies without undue hindrance. However, the organization's strong ideological focus and involvement in contentious legal battles highlight the need for careful consideration of its activities and impact ([American Mind](https://americanmind.org), [Notus](https://www.notus.org)).
