# Alliance Defending Freedom

## Overview
Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) is a prominent conservative Christian legal advocacy group founded in 1993. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, ADF has expanded its influence significantly, with operations in Washington, D.C., New York, and internationally through its subsidiary, ADF International. The organization focuses on defending religious freedoms, opposing LGBTQ rights, and advocating for conservative Christian values in the legal and public policy arenas. ADF has been involved in numerous high-profile cases, including those challenging abortion rights and same-sex marriage ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Defending_Freedom), [ADF Legal](https://adflegal.org)).

## Mission and Activities
ADF's mission is to protect what it considers God-given rights through legal means, including litigation, training, and advocacy. Key areas of focus include:
- **Religious Freedom:** ADF defends individuals and organizations against government actions that it perceives as infringing on religious liberties, particularly in cases involving public expressions of faith ([ADF Legal](https://adflegal.org)).
- **Sanctity of Life:** ADF advocates against abortion and euthanasia, frequently supporting legislation and litigating cases that seek to restrict abortion access, including the pivotal *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* case that led to the overturning of *Roe v. Wade* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Defending_Freedom)).
- **Marriage and Family:** ADF opposes same-sex marriage and supports traditional definitions of marriage, having played a significant role in cases that allow businesses to refuse services for same-sex weddings based on religious beliefs ([SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org)).
- **Free Speech:** ADF defends the rights of individuals to express their beliefs without government censorship, particularly in cases where speech intersects with religious convictions ([ADF Legal](https://adflegal.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Kristen Waggoner:** CEO, President, and General Counsel. Waggoner leads the organizationâ€™s strategic direction and legal operations, emphasizing ADF's commitment to religious liberty and free speech.
- **Michael Farris:** Former CEO and current Chairman, Farris is well-known for his work in homeschooling advocacy and religious freedom litigation, significantly shaping ADF's legal strategies and public outreach ([ADF Legal](https://adflegal.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Defending_Freedom)).

## Connections to Trump
ADF has had strong ties to the Trump administration, with several former ADF attorneys holding significant positions, such as Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson. The organization's influence extended into key policy areas under Trump, particularly those involving religious liberty and opposition to LGBTQ rights. ADF's legal strategies have frequently aligned with Trump's broader conservative agenda, reinforcing their mutual influence on U.S. law and policy ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Defending_Freedom), [WSWS](https://www.wsws.org)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** ADF's advocacy and legal actions are closely aligned with conservative Christian values, leading to criticism from liberal groups and civil rights organizations. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) designates ADF as an anti-LGBTQ hate group due to its opposition to LGBTQ rights and advocacy for laws that restrict these rights ([SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org), [WSWS](https://www.wsws.org)).
- **Controversial Stances:** ADF has been involved in numerous high-profile cases, including those seeking to restrict abortion rights and opposing same-sex marriage. These actions have sparked significant debate and controversy regarding their impact on civil liberties and equality under the law ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Defending_Freedom), [SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org)).

## Conclusion
Alliance Defending Freedom plays a pivotal role in the conservative Christian legal landscape, significantly influencing legal and policy debates in the United States. While its strong advocacy for religious freedoms and conservative values underscores its impact on American society, its positions and connections have drawn considerable criticism and controversy. The organization's involvement in shaping key legal precedents has made it a powerful force in the ongoing cultural and political battles in the U.S. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Defending_Freedom), [ADF Legal](https://adflegal.org)).
