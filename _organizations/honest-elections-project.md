# Honest Elections Project (HEP)

## Overview
The Honest Elections Project (HEP) is a conservative advocacy group established in 2020. It aims to ensure electoral integrity through public engagement, advocacy, and public-interest litigation. HEP focuses on promoting what it considers to be fair, reasonable, and common-sense measures to protect the integrity of the voting process. The organization operates under The 85 Fund, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization ([Honest Elections Project](https://www.honestelections.org), [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Honest_Elections_Project)).

## Mission and Activities
HEP's mission is to support the right of every lawful voter to participate in free and honest elections. Key activities include:
- **Election Reform Advocacy:** Promoting policies to secure the voting process, safeguard absentee ballots, and guarantee voting access. HEP advocates for robust pre- and post-election audits, voter identification requirements, and maintenance of accurate voter rolls ([Honest Elections Project](https://www.honestelections.org)).
- **Public-Interest Litigation:** Engaging in legal battles to uphold election laws and challenge what it views as unlawful changes to voting procedures ([Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Honest_Elections_Project)).
- **Public Engagement:** Conducting surveys and educational campaigns to inform and mobilize public opinion in support of election integrity measures ([Honest Elections Project](https://www.honestelections.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Jason Snead:** Executive Director, formerly a senior policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation. Snead managed the development of the Heritage Election Fraud Database and has been a vocal advocate for election integrity, emphasizing the need for stringent voting laws ([Honest Elections Project](https://www.honestelections.org)).

## Connections to Trump
HEP has notable connections to the Trump administration, particularly through its advocacy for policies that were prominent during Trump's presidency. The organization's focus on voter ID laws, opposition to mail-in voting expansions, and emphasis on auditing election results align closely with the rhetoric and policies promoted by Trump and his affiliates ([Honest Elections Project](https://www.honestelections.org), [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Honest_Elections_Project)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias and Controversy:** HEP has been criticized for promoting policies that could suppress voter turnout among minority and low-income populations. Its strong stance against mail-in voting and the use of private funds for election administration has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that these measures could disenfranchise legitimate voters ([Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Honest_Elections_Project)).

## Conclusion
The Honest Elections Project is a significant player in the conservative movement to reform election laws and ensure voting integrity. Its efforts, aligned with the broader agenda of the Trump administration, emphasize stringent voting requirements and robust election audits. However, its controversial stances and potential impacts on voter accessibility highlight the need for balanced scrutiny of its advocacy and policy proposals ([Honest Elections Project](https://www.honestelections.org), [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Honest_Elections_Project)).
