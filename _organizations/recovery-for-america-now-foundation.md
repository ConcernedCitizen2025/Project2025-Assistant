# Recovery for America Now Foundation (RANF)

## Overview
The Recovery for America Now Foundation (RANF) is a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., dedicated to providing access to addiction treatment for individuals suffering from substance use disorders. Founded on the belief that every person has intrinsic value and the potential for recovery, RANF focuses on closing the treatment gap by offering scholarships to those in need. The foundation operates with the understanding that treatment is the beginning of a lifelong journey toward recovery and fulfillment ([Recovery for America Now](https://www.recoveryforamerica.org)).

## Mission and Activities
RANF's mission is to make treatment accessible to all individuals suffering from addiction. Key activities include:
- **Scholarships for Treatment:** RANF provides financial assistance to individuals who need help covering the costs of addiction treatment. The foundation collaborates with a network of treatment centers to identify and support those in need, ensuring that financial barriers do not prevent access to recovery ([Recovery for America Now](https://www.recoveryforamerica.org)).
- **Policy Advocacy:** RANF advocates for policy changes to expand treatment capacity and influence policies that support recovery and independence. This includes efforts to repeal regulations that limit federal Medicaid financing for residential treatment facilities, such as the IMD exclusion ([Recovery for America Now](https://www.recoveryforamerica.org)).
- **Lifelong Recovery Support:** The foundation builds a community among alumni, focusing on education, employment, and life skills development to ensure long-term success and well-being in recovery ([Recovery for America Now](https://www.recoveryforamerica.org)).
