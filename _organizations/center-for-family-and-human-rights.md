# Center for Family and Human Rights

## Overview
The Center for Family and Human Rights (C-FAM) is a conservative advocacy group founded in 1997, initially known as the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute. The organization aims to influence social policy debates at the United Nations and other international institutions, particularly in areas concerning life and family. C-FAM is known for its opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage, and gender identity policies, advocating for traditional interpretations of human rights that align with conservative Christian values.

## Mission and Activities
C-FAM's mission is to restore a traditional understanding of international law and human rights. Key activities include:
- **Advocacy:** Engaging with UN policymakers to promote pro-life and pro-family positions, while opposing initiatives that support LGBTQ rights and abortion.
- **Research and Publications:** Producing reports and articles that argue for conservative perspectives on human rights issues, aimed at influencing international policy discussions.
- **Coalition Building:** Collaborating with other conservative organizations worldwide to strengthen efforts in promoting life and family values at the international level.

## Connections to Trump
C-FAM is connected to the Trump administration through its alignment with Trump’s pro-life and pro-family agenda. The organization’s involvement in Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative aimed at preparing conservative policies for future Republican administrations, underscores its influence within conservative circles and its alignment with Trump-era policies.

## Concerns
- **Controversial Positions:** C-FAM's strong stance on issues like abortion, same-sex marriage, and gender identity has drawn significant criticism. The organization has been accused of undermining broader human rights efforts, particularly in its support for policies that criminalize homosexuality and restrict LGBTQ rights. C-FAM's involvement with repressive governments at the UN to oppose LGBTQ rights has further heightened concerns about its impact on global human rights norms.
- **Violent Rhetoric:** Austin Ruse, C-FAM’s president, has been involved in several controversies due to his inflammatory and sometimes violent rhetoric, including comments that led to significant backlash and raised questions about C-FAM's standing at international forums like the United Nations.

## Conclusion
The Center for Family and Human Rights plays a significant role in conservative advocacy at the international level, particularly at the UN. While its mission to defend life and family is clear, its controversial positions and the potential impact on global human rights efforts require close scrutiny. As C-FAM continues to influence policy, its role in shaping international human rights discourse will be critical to monitor.
