# Center for Family and Human Rights

## Overview
The Center for Family and Human Rights (C-FAM) is a conservative advocacy group founded in 1997, originally known as the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute. The organization was established to influence social policy debates at the United Nations and other international institutions, focusing on upholding conservative values concerning life and family. C-FAM has been a vocal opponent of abortion, same-sex marriage, and gender identity policies, positioning itself as a defender of traditional human rights interpretations ([C-FAM](https://c-fam.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Family_and_Human_Rights)).

## Mission and Activities
C-FAM aims to reestablish a traditional understanding of international law and protect national sovereignty and human dignity. Key activities include:
- **Advocacy:** Engaging with policymakers at the UN and other international bodies to promote pro-life and pro-family positions. C-FAM has been particularly active in opposing initiatives that it views as promoting LGBTQ rights or abortion ([C-FAM](https://c-fam.org)).
- **Research and Publications:** The organization produces reports, briefs, and articles that support its advocacy goals and provide conservative perspectives on human rights issues. These publications are part of its broader strategy to influence international human rights discourse ([C-FAM](https://c-fam.org)).
- **Coalition Building:** C-FAM works with other like-minded organizations to strengthen global efforts to protect life and family, forming alliances that support its mission ([Right Wing Watch](https://www.rightwingwatch.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Austin Ruse:** President of C-FAM, Ruse has been a prominent figure in conservative advocacy, especially at the UN. He is known for his strong stance against LGBTQ rights and has been involved in controversial statements and actions that have drawn both support and criticism within conservative and liberal circles ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Family_and_Human_Rights), [Right Wing Watch](https://www.rightwingwatch.org)).
- **Wendy Wright:** Vice President, Wright previously served as President of Concerned Women for America and is recognized for her activism on pro-life and pro-family issues ([C-FAM](https://c-fam.org)).
- **Susan Yoshihara:** Senior Vice President for Research and Director of the International Organizations Research Group, Yoshihara contributes to the strategic direction and research output of C-FAM, particularly in the areas of international human rights ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Family_and_Human_Rights)).

## Connections to Trump
C-FAM has connections to the Trump administration through its advocacy work and involvement in international policy debates. The organization’s alignment with Trump’s pro-life and pro-family agenda is evident in its support for policies that restrict abortion and promote traditional family structures. C-FAM is also a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative to shape conservative policy for a future Republican administration ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Family_and_Human_Rights)).

## Concerns
- **Controversial Positions:** C-FAM's strong stance on issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and gender identity has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that the organization's positions may undermine broader human rights efforts, particularly those related to LGBTQ rights and reproductive health. Additionally, C-FAM’s collaboration with repressive governments to resist international recognition of LGBTQ rights raises further concerns about its impact on global human rights norms ([Right Wing Watch](https://www.rightwingwatch.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Family_and_Human_Rights)).

## Conclusion
The Center for Family and Human Rights is a significant player in conservative advocacy at the international level. Its mission to protect life and family through traditional interpretations of human rights is influential, particularly at the UN. However, its controversial positions and potential impact on global human rights efforts necessitate careful scrutiny and consideration ([C-FAM](https://c-fam.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Family_and_Human_Rights)).
