# Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD)

## Overview
The Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) is a Washington, D.C.-based policy institute founded in 2001, primarily focusing on foreign policy and national security issues. The organization promotes pluralism, democratic values, and counterterrorism efforts. FDD is known for its research, advocacy, and events aimed at influencing U.S. and international policies. It has been particularly active in shaping U.S. policies regarding Iran, cybersecurity, and counterterrorism ([FDD](https://www.fdd.org), [On Think Tanks](https://onthinktanks.org)).

## Mission and Activities
FDD's mission is to strengthen U.S. national security and counter global threats through rigorous research and advocacy. Key activities include:
- **Research and Analysis:** FDD publishes detailed research on topics such as terrorism, national security, cyber threats, and foreign policy, aiming to inform policymakers and the public ([FDD](https://www.fdd.org)).
- **Policy Advocacy:** The organization provides recommendations to U.S. and international policymakers on critical issues, including Iran's nuclear program, cybersecurity, and counterterrorism ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Defense_of_Democracies)).
- **Publications and Events:** FDD hosts events, roundtables, and panel discussions to foster dialogue on security issues. It also publishes the Long War Journal, which reports on terrorism and related topics ([On Think Tanks](https://onthinktanks.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Clifford D. May:** Founder and President of FDD, May has a background in journalism and policy analysis, focusing on national security issues ([FDD](https://www.fdd.org)).
- **Mark Dubowitz:** CEO, Dubowitz is renowned for his work on Iran sanctions and has been a key figure in advocating for policies to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. He has advised several U.S. administrations on these issues ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dubowitz)).
- **Toby Dershowitz:** Senior Vice President for Government Relations and Strategy, Dershowitz oversees FDD's interactions with policymakers and strategic initiatives ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).

## Connections to Trump
FDD has been influential within the Trump administration, particularly in shaping policies related to Iran and the Middle East. The organization supported the administration's hardline stance on Iran, including the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the imposition of sanctions ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Defense_of_Democracies), [Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** FDD has been described as having a right-leaning bias, often supporting conservative and neoconservative positions. This has raised concerns about the objectivity of its research and policy recommendations ([Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com)).
- **Hawkish Stance:** The organization is known for its aggressive policy recommendations, particularly regarding Iran and terrorism. Critics argue that FDD's positions can sometimes escalate conflicts rather than promote diplomatic solutions ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Defense_of_Democracies)).

## Conclusion
The Foundation for Defense of Democracies is a significant player in U.S. national security and foreign policy discourse. Its research and advocacy efforts have influenced key policy decisions, particularly in relation to Iran and counterterrorism. However, its strong political bias and aggressive policy stances warrant careful consideration and balanced evaluation of its contributions to public policy ([FDD](https://www.fdd.org), [On Think Tanks](https://onthinktanks.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Defense_of_Democracies)).
