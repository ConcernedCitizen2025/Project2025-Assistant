# Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD)

## Overview
The Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) is a Washington, D.C.-based policy institute founded in 2001, focusing on foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism. The organization advocates for democratic values and the defense of free societies against threats posed by terrorism and authoritarian regimes. FDD is known for its research, policy recommendations, and events aimed at influencing U.S. and international policies, particularly concerning Iran, cybersecurity, and Middle Eastern affairs.

## Mission and Activities
FDD's mission is to strengthen U.S. national security and counter global threats through rigorous research and advocacy. Key activities include:
- **Research and Analysis:** FDD conducts in-depth research on terrorism, national security, cyber threats, and foreign policy. This research is intended to inform policymakers and the public about emerging threats and strategies for countering them.
- **Policy Advocacy:** The organization provides recommendations to U.S. and international policymakers on critical issues such as Iran's nuclear program, counterterrorism efforts, and cybersecurity. FDD has played a significant role in shaping U.S. sanctions policies against Iran.
- **Publications and Events:** FDD hosts events, roundtables, and panel discussions to foster dialogue on security issues. It also publishes the *Long War Journal*, which focuses on terrorism and related topics.

## Leadership and Influence
- **Clifford D. May:** Founder and President of FDD, May has a background in journalism and policy analysis with a focus on national security. He has been instrumental in guiding the organization's direction since its inception.
- **Mark Dubowitz:** CEO of FDD, Dubowitz is a prominent figure in advocating for tough sanctions against Iran. His work has significantly influenced U.S. policy on Iran, especially during the Trump administration.
- **Toby Dershowitz:** Senior Vice President for Government Relations and Strategy, Dershowitz oversees FDDâ€™s interactions with policymakers and helps shape its strategic initiatives.

## Connections to Trump
FDD was influential during the Trump administration, particularly in shaping policies related to Iran and the Middle East. The organization supported Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the imposition of stringent sanctions on Iran. FDD's alignment with Trump's hardline stance on Iran and other Middle Eastern issues underscores its significant role in U.S. foreign policy during his administration.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** FDD is often described as having a right-leaning bias, particularly in its support for neoconservative and pro-Israel positions. This has raised concerns about the objectivity of its research and policy recommendations.
- **Hawkish Stance:** The organization is known for its aggressive policy recommendations, particularly regarding Iran and terrorism. Critics argue that FDD's positions can escalate conflicts rather than promote diplomatic solutions.

## Conclusion
The Foundation for Defense of Democracies is a significant player in U.S. national security and foreign policy discourse. Its research and advocacy efforts have influenced key policy decisions, particularly in relation to Iran and counterterrorism. However, its strong political bias and aggressive policy stances warrant careful consideration and balanced evaluation of its contributions to public policy.
