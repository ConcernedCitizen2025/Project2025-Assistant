# Concerned Women for America (CWA)

## Overview
Concerned Women for America (CWA) is a socially conservative evangelical Christian non-profit organization founded in 1978 by Beverly LaHaye. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., CWA is one of the largest public policy women's organizations in the United States, focusing on promoting Biblical values and Constitutional principles through prayer, education, and advocacy. The organization is heavily involved in social and political movements, advocating on issues such as the sanctity of life, defense of family, religious liberty, education, national sovereignty, and support for Israel.

## Mission and Activities
CWA's mission is to impact the culture for Christ through public policy. Key activities include representing conservative Christian values on Capitol Hill, running programs like Young Women for America (YWA) to train and equip the next generation of Christian conservative women, and publishing articles and reports to influence public opinion from a Christian conservative perspective.
