# Concerned Women for America (CWA)

## Overview
Concerned Women for America (CWA) is a socially conservative evangelical Christian non-profit organization founded in 1978 by Beverly LaHaye. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., CWA is one of the largest public policy women's organizations in the United States, focusing on promoting Biblical values and Constitutional principles through prayer, education, and advocacy. The organization is heavily involved in social and political movements, advocating on issues such as the sanctity of life, defense of family, religious liberty, education, national sovereignty, and support for Israel ([CWA](https://concernedwomen.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerned_Women_for_America)).

## Mission and Activities
CWA's mission is to impact the culture for Christ through public policy. Key activities include:
- **Policy Advocacy:** Representing conservative Christian values on Capitol Hill, CWA advocates for policies that align with their principles, including anti-abortion legislation, religious liberty protections, and traditional family values ([CWA](https://concernedwomen.org)).
- **Education and Outreach:** CWA runs programs like Young Women for America (YWA) to train and equip the next generation of Christian conservative women. These programs focus on leadership development and policy advocacy to ensure the continuation of CWA’s mission ([CWA](https://concernedwomen.org)).
- **Publications and Media:** The organization regularly publishes articles, op-eds, and reports to influence public opinion and provide a conservative perspective on current issues. Penny Nance, the CEO, is a frequent commentator on national media platforms, discussing cultural and policy issues from a Christian conservative viewpoint ([Wealthy Spy](https://wealthyspy.com)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Penny Young Nance:** CEO and President of CWA, Nance has led the organization since 2010 and is a recognized authority on cultural, children's, and women's issues. Under her leadership, CWA has expanded its influence, particularly in conservative policy circles. Nance is also a senior advisor at the Christian Post and a frequent media commentator ([CWA](https://concernedwomen.org), [Wealthy Spy](https://wealthyspy.com)).
- **Timothy LaHaye:** Co-founder and husband of Beverly LaHaye, Timothy was an evangelical Christian minister and author who played a significant role in shaping the organization’s focus on traditional Christian values ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerned_Women_for_America)).

## Connections to Trump
CWA has supported and aligned with the Trump administration, particularly in areas like religious liberty and anti-abortion policies. Penny Nance served on Trump’s Life Advisory Council and frequently represented Christian conservative women at the White House. The organization’s alignment with Trump’s policies has amplified its influence within the Republican Party and solidified its role in promoting a conservative agenda ([Wealthy Spy](https://wealthyspy.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerned_Women_for_America)).

## Concerns
- **Extreme Right Bias and Hate Group Designation:** CWA has been criticized for its extreme right-wing bias and was designated as an anti-LGBTQ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center due to its stance on LGBTQ rights and other social issues. This designation highlights ongoing concerns about the organization’s impact on civil rights and inclusivity ([SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerned_Women_for_America)).

## Conclusion
Concerned Women for America is a prominent conservative organization dedicated to promoting Biblical values in public policy. While it has a significant following and influence, its controversial stances on LGBTQ rights and alignment with extreme right-wing ideologies highlight the need for critical examination of its activities and advocacy efforts ([CWA](https://concernedwomen.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerned_Women_for_America)).
