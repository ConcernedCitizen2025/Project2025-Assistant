# The American Conservative (TAC)

## Overview
The American Conservative (TAC) is a magazine founded in 2002 by Pat Buchanan, Scott McConnell, and Taki Theodoracopulos. It was established in response to the growing dominance of neoconservative ideologies within the Republican Party. TAC promotes traditional conservative values, focusing on non-interventionism, civil liberties, and economic restraint. The publication positions itself as an alternative voice within the conservative movement, advocating for "Main Street conservatism" that emphasizes community, localism, and realism in foreign affairs.

## Mission and Activities

- **Publications:** The magazine publishes articles challenging mainstream conservative positions, particularly critiquing expansive military interventions and globalist economic policies.
- **Commentary and Analysis:** TAC provides in-depth analysis on U.S. foreign policy, domestic issues, and cultural debates.
- **Events and Conferences:** TAC hosts events to engage with readers and promote its conservative values, featuring prominent thinkers aligned with its vision.

## Connections to Trump
TAC has had a nuanced relationship with the Trump administration, supporting some policies while critiquing others that diverge from traditional conservative principles. This reflects TAC's mission to critique both the Republican establishment and neoconservative approaches within the GOP.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** TAC’s strong conservative stance and opposition to neoconservative views may limit the diversity of perspectives and impact objectivity.
- **Critique of Mainstream Conservatism:** TAC’s critique of mainstream conservatism and challenge to neoconservative orthodoxy has sparked debates within the conservative movement.

## Conclusion
