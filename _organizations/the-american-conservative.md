# The American Conservative (TAC)

## Overview
The American Conservative (TAC) is a magazine founded in 2002 by Pat Buchanan, Scott McConnell, and Taki Theodoracopulos. It was established as a response to the growing dominance of neoconservative ideologies within the Republican Party, particularly regarding foreign policy and globalism. TAC promotes traditional conservative values, focusing on non-interventionism, civil liberties, and economic restraint. The publication positions itself as an alternative voice within the conservative movement, advocating for "Main Street conservatism" that emphasizes the importance of community, localism, and realism in foreign affairs ([The American Conservative](https://www.theamericanconservative.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative)).

## Mission and Activities
TAC’s mission is to offer an alternative voice in the conservative movement, advocating for what it describes as "Main Street conservatism." Key activities include:
- **Publications:** The magazine publishes articles on politics, culture, and current events, often challenging mainstream conservative positions. It is known for its critique of both neoconservative and neoliberal policies, particularly those that favor expansive military interventions and globalist economic policies ([The American Conservative](https://www.theamericanconservative.com)).
- **Commentary and Analysis:** TAC provides in-depth analysis on U.S. foreign policy, promoting non-interventionism and criticizing U.S. military engagements abroad. It also covers domestic issues like civil liberties, economic policy, and cultural debates ([TAC Right Now](https://amconrightnow.libsyn.com)).
- **Events and Conferences:** TAC hosts events and discussions to engage with readers and promote its conservative values. These gatherings often feature prominent conservative thinkers and policymakers who align with TAC's vision ([The American Conservative](https://www.theamericanconservative.com)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **W. James Antle III:** Editor-in-Chief, Antle has been with TAC since 2011 and has guided its editorial direction, focusing on the ideological shifts within the conservative movement. His leadership has been crucial in maintaining TAC's critical stance towards mainstream GOP policies ([The American Conservative](https://www.theamericanconservative.com)).
- **Helen Andrews:** Senior Editor, Andrews is known for her work on cultural and political issues, providing critical perspectives on contemporary conservative thought. Her contributions help shape TAC’s commentary on both domestic and international affairs ([TAC Right Now](https://amconrightnow.libsyn.com)).

## Connections to Trump
TAC has maintained a nuanced relationship with the Trump administration. While the publication has supported some of Trump's policies, particularly those related to trade and foreign policy, it has also been critical of aspects of his administration that diverge from traditional conservative principles. This reflects TAC's broader mission to critique both the Republican establishment and the neoconservative approach that has dominated GOP policies in recent decades ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative), [The American Conservative](https://www.theamericanconservative.com)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** TAC is known for its strong conservative bias, particularly its opposition to neoconservative views within the GOP. While it provides a platform for traditional conservative voices, its ideological stance may limit the diversity of perspectives presented, potentially impacting the objectivity of its content ([Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com)).
- **Critique of Mainstream Conservatism:** TAC's critique of mainstream conservatism and its challenge to neoconservative orthodoxy have sparked debates within the conservative movement. The publication's emphasis on non-interventionism and its skepticism of large-scale government and corporate power are central to these discussions ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative)).

## Conclusion
The American Conservative plays a significant role in promoting traditional conservative values and providing critical analysis of neoconservative and neoliberal policies. Its focus on non-interventionism, civil liberties, and economic restraint offers an alternative perspective within the conservative movement. However, its strong ideological stance and critique of mainstream conservatism require careful consideration of its contributions to public discourse ([The American Conservative](https://www.theamericanconservative.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative)).
