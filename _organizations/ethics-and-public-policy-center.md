# Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC)

## Overview
The Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) is a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., founded in 1976 by political theorist Ernest W. Lefever. EPPC's mission is to apply the principles of the Judeo-Christian tradition to contemporary issues of law, culture, and politics, with a focus on America's civic and cultural renewal. The organization is particularly influential in promoting conservative values related to religious liberty, bioethics, and social issues ([EPPC](https://eppc.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_and_Public_Policy_Center)).

## Mission and Activities
EPPC focuses on promoting conservative values through research, publications, and advocacy. Key activities include:
- **Policy Advocacy:** EPPC engages in policy discussions on various topics, including bioethics, religious freedom, education, and family values. The organization is known for its opposition to progressive social policies, particularly those related to LGBTQ rights and gender identity ([EPPC](https://eppc.org)).
- **Publications and Research:** The center publishes articles, reports, and books addressing critical public policy issues from a conservative perspective. These include discussions on religious liberty, the sanctity of life, and critiques of modern liberal ideologies ([EPPC](https://eppc.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_and_Public_Policy_Center)).
- **Programs and Initiatives:** EPPC runs several initiatives, such as the HHS Accountability Project, Life and Family Initiative, and the Bioethics and American Democracy project, which address specific policy areas and promote conservative views ([EPPC](https://eppc.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Ryan T. Anderson:** President of EPPC, Anderson is a prominent conservative scholar known for his work on religious liberty and bioethics. He has written extensively on these topics, including controversial positions on gender identity and marriage. Anderson's leadership has further solidified EPPC's influence in conservative circles ([EPPC](https://eppc.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_T._Anderson)).
- **George Weigel:** Distinguished Senior Fellow, Weigel is a well-known Catholic theologian and author who contributes to EPPC's discussions on religion and public life. His work often emphasizes the role of Christianity in shaping Western civilization ([EPPC](https://eppc.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_and_Public_Policy_Center)).
- **Roger Severino:** Senior Fellow, Severino focuses on health and human services, particularly issues relating to religious liberty and civil rights. His work often challenges federal policies that conflict with conservative Christian values ([EPPC](https://eppc.org)).

## Connections to Trump
EPPC has maintained strong connections with the Trump administration, influencing policy discussions particularly in areas related to religious liberty and conservative social values. The organization is also part of Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative aimed at shaping conservative policy for a potential future Republican administration ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_and_Public_Policy_Center), [EPPC](https://eppc.org)).

## Concerns
- **Right-Wing Bias:** EPPC is noted for its strong conservative bias, which can influence its policy recommendations and public discourse. The reliance on biased sources and the promotion of conservative viewpoints may limit the objectivity of EPPC's research and recommendations, raising concerns about the accuracy and fairness of its work ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_and_Public_Policy_Center), [EPPC](https://eppc.org)).

## Conclusion
The Ethics and Public Policy Center plays a significant role in promoting conservative values in American public policy. While its efforts are influential in shaping conservative thought, the strong bias and potential lack of objectivity in its publications warrant careful consideration. As EPPC continues to engage in policy debates, its impact on the political landscape and public opinion will remain substantial ([EPPC](https://eppc.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_and_Public_Policy_Center)).
