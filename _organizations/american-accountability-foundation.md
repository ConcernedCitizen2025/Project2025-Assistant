# American Accountability Foundation

## Overview
The American Accountability Foundation (AAF) is a conservative nonprofit organization founded in 2020. It focuses on government oversight and research, aiming to promote transparency and accountability within the federal government. The organization is known for its aggressive opposition to Biden administration nominees and policies, often through the use of opposition research, ethics complaints, and public campaigns. AAF has played a significant role in derailing several high-profile Biden nominees, including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and FCC nominee Gigi Sohn ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Accountability_Foundation), [Politico](https://www.politico.com), [American Accountability Foundation](https://www.americanaccountabilityfoundation.com)).

## Mission and Activities
AAF's mission is to educate the public on issues related to government personnel, policy, and spending through rigorous investigative research and public advocacy. Key activities include:
- **Investigative Research:** AAF conducts in-depth investigations into political appointees and government officials to expose waste, fraud, and abuse. The organization has targeted numerous Biden appointees, using its research to influence public opinion and legislative decisions ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Accountability_Foundation), [Politico](https://www.politico.com)).
- **Public Advocacy:** AAF publishes reports, white papers, and press releases aimed at informing the public and policymakers about its findings. The foundation actively works to shape public opinion and influence policy decisions through aggressive campaigns ([American Accountability Foundation](https://www.americanaccountabilityfoundation.com)).
- **Project Sovereignty 2025:** An initiative focused on identifying high-ranking civil servants within the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Justice (DOJ) who might obstruct a conservative administration’s agenda, particularly regarding immigration. This project is part of the broader Project 2025 initiative supported by the Heritage Foundation ([Federal Times](https://www.federaltimes.com), [American Accountability Foundation](https://www.americanaccountabilityfoundation.com)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Tom Jones:** Founder and President of AAF, Jones has a background in political policy and research, including roles such as Legislative Director for Senator Ron Johnson and running opposition research for Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. He is known for his aggressive tactics and deep connections within the conservative movement ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Accountability_Foundation), [Federal Times](https://www.federaltimes.com)).
- **Jerome Trankle:** Research Director, Trankle has experience with the Cannon Research Group and has worked closely with conservative figures like Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Andy Barr, focusing on gathering and analyzing opposition research ([American Accountability Foundation](https://www.americanaccountabilityfoundation.com)).

## Connections to Trump
AAF is connected to the Trump administration through its advisory role in Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative designed to shape conservative policy for future Republican administrations. The organization’s efforts to oppose Biden administration nominees and policies closely align with the broader goals of the conservative movement, reflecting its deep ties to Trump-era politics ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Accountability_Foundation), [Federal Times](https://www.federaltimes.com)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** AAF’s strong conservative stance and aggressive tactics in opposing Biden administration nominees and policies have led to criticisms of bias. The organization’s methods, including filing ethics complaints and releasing opposition research, have been characterized as unethical by some critics, raising questions about the fairness and integrity of its operations ([Politico](https://www.politico.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Accountability_Foundation)).
- **Controversial Tactics:** AAF has been involved in various high-profile campaigns that have drawn criticism for their aggressive nature. This includes its role in derailing the nomination of Gigi Sohn to the FCC, a campaign that was heavily funded by dark money and characterized by misleading and partisan attacks ([Politico](https://www.politico.com), [Federal Times](https://www.federaltimes.com)).

## Conclusion
The American Accountability Foundation plays a significant role in conservative political advocacy, focusing on government oversight and transparency. Its strong ideological stance and connections to conservative movements underscore its influence but also warrant careful consideration of its methods and potential biases. The organization’s involvement in Project 2025 and its aggressive campaigns against Biden nominees highlight its significant impact on the current political landscape ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Accountability_Foundation), [Politico](https://www.politico.com)).
