# Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI)

## Overview
The Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI) is a non-profit organization founded in 2017 by former U.S. Senator Jim DeMint. Based in Washington, D.C., CPI has quickly become a central hub for the conservative movement, particularly for those aligned with former President Donald Trump. The organization is dedicated to supporting conservative leaders and staffers in Washington by providing them with resources, training, and a network to advance conservative principles and policies. CPI is also deeply involved in election integrity initiatives and has established itself as a significant force in the MAGA movement.

## Mission and Activities
CPI focuses on several key areas to support the conservative movement:
- **Staffing:** CPI identifies, interviews, and recommends conservative staffers for positions in Congress and other conservative organizations. This effort ensures that like-minded individuals occupy key roles within the legislative process, helping to shape policy from within.
- **Education and Training:** The institute offers regular training seminars on House and Senate procedures, floor strategies, communications, and various policy areas. These programs are designed to enhance the skills and knowledge of conservative staffers and policymakers, with an emphasis on advancing the America First agenda.
- **Incubation:** CPI helps launch new conservative organizations by providing administrative, staffing, and legal support. Notable groups incubated by CPI include America First Legal, Center for Renewing America, and the American Accountability Foundation.
- **Coalition Building:** CPI facilitates networking and strategic collaborations among conservative leaders, activists, and scholars to advance key issues, particularly those related to election integrity.

## Connections to Trump
CPI has strong ties to the Trump administration, with several former officials from Trump’s team holding key positions within the institute. The organization has been instrumental in promoting Trump's policies and continues to play a central role in the broader MAGA movement. CPI also received a $1 million donation from Trump’s Save America PAC, underscoring its close alignment with Trump’s political agenda.

## Concerns
- **Election Integrity Focus:** CPI’s emphasis on election integrity, including advocating for stringent voter verification laws, has raised concerns about potential voter suppression efforts. The organization has been involved in several statewide election integrity summits, which have been criticized for promoting policies that could restrict voting access.

## Conclusion
The Conservative Partnership Institute plays a crucial role in supporting and advancing conservative principles in U.S. politics. Its focus on training, staffing, and coalition-building has made it a significant player in the conservative movement. However, its strong ties to the Trump administration and controversial stances on issues like election integrity highlight the need for careful scrutiny of its activities and influence.
