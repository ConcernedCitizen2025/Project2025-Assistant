# Center for Equal Opportunity

## Overview
The Center for Equal Opportunity (CEO) is a conservative think tank founded in 1995 by Linda Chavez. The organization promotes a colorblind approach to public policy, advocating against affirmative action and race-based preferences. CEO focuses on research, legal advocacy, and public outreach to support its mission of ensuring equal treatment under the law, irrespective of race, ethnicity, or gender.

## Mission and Activities
CEO advocates for nondiscriminatory public policies by conducting research and engaging in legal and public outreach activities:
- **Research and Studies:** CEO conducts studies on racial and ethnic preferences, particularly in college admissions, to highlight its opposition to affirmative action.
- **Legal Advocacy:** The organization files legal briefs challenging the use of race, sex, and national origin in education and employment, advocating for equal treatment under the law.
- **Public Outreach:** CEO actively participates in public debates and media engagements, promoting its colorblind approach to public policy.

## Leadership and Influence
- **Linda Chavez:** Founder and Chairman, Chavez has been a leading critic of affirmative action and a prominent voice in advocating for colorblind public policies. Her background includes roles in the Reagan administration and as a syndicated columnist.
- **Devon Westhill:** President and General Counsel, Westhill previously served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the Trump administration and is a vocal advocate against race-based admissions policies.
- **Rudy Gersten:** Executive Director, Gersten oversees CEO's operations and public relations, contributing to the organization's strategic initiatives.

## Connections to Trump
CEO has ties to the Trump administration, particularly through Devon Westhill's role in the Trump administration and the organization's participation in Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative aimed at shaping conservative policies for future Republican administrations. CEO's involvement in this project underscores its influence within conservative policy circles.

## Concerns
- **Opposition to Affirmative Action:** CEO's stance against affirmative action has sparked significant debate, with critics arguing that its colorblind approach may fail to address historical and systemic inequalities.
- **Political Bias:** CEO's alignment with conservative policies and its involvement in initiatives like Project 2025 raise concerns about its influence on future policymaking, potentially prioritizing conservative agendas over broader societal needs.

## Conclusion
The Center for Equal Opportunity is a key player in the conservative movement, advocating for colorblind public policies and equal treatment under the law. While its mission aligns with conservative values, its opposition to affirmative action and ties to the Trump administration warrant close scrutiny. CEO's continued influence on national policy and its role in shaping the future political landscape will be important to monitor.
