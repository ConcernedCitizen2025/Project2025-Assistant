# National Association of Scholars (NAS)

## Overview
The National Association of Scholars (NAS) is a conservative non-profit organization established in 1987. It aims to reform higher education by promoting the standards of a liberal arts education that fosters intellectual freedom, truth-seeking, and virtuous citizenship. NAS operates through advocacy, research reports, and public engagement to defend academic freedom and integrity.

## Mission and Activities
NAS's mission is to promote intellectual freedom and uphold the standards of a liberal arts education. Key activities include:
- **Publishing In-Depth Reports:** NAS critiques contemporary academic practices through reports on issues like curriculum reform and academic freedom.
- **Advocacy Efforts:** The organization influences education policy, protects academic freedom by filing amicus briefs in legal cases, and testifies before legislative committees.
- **Publications:** NAS publishes the quarterly journal *Academic Questions*, which addresses issues in higher education, including the intersection of politics, ideology, scholarship, and teaching.

## Leadership and Influence
- **[Peter W. Wood](https://fedsoc.org/contributors/peter-wood):** President of NAS. Wood has been an influential voice in conservative education circles, advocating for traditional liberal arts education and opposing what he views as the politicization of higher education.
- **[Stanley Young](https://www.desmog.com/2020/02/07/dark-moneyed-denialists-fixing-science-symposium-doubt/):** Director of the Shifting Sands Project, focusing on applied statistics. Young has a significant background in the pharmaceutical industry and environmental policy.
- **Neetu Arnold:** Research Fellow known for her reports on higher education costs and campus culture, highlighting issues such as administrative bloat and curriculum changes.

## Connections to Trump
NAS is listed as a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, an initiative organized by the Heritage Foundation to develop conservative policy proposals for future Republican administrations. This connection underscores NAS's role in shaping conservative educational policy and its alignment with broader conservative agendas. The organization's involvement with Project 2025 aligns with the initiative's goals to reshape U.S. federal government operations, potentially under a future Trump administration.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** NAS is considered right-biased, advocating for conservative educational perspectives and often criticizing progressive academic policies. This bias has raised questions about the objectivity of its research and the balance of viewpoints it presents.
- **Controversies:** NAS has faced criticism for its opposition to multiculturalism and diversity initiatives in higher education. Critics argue that these positions can undermine efforts to create inclusive and equitable academic environments.
- **Influence on Curriculum:** NAS's reports and advocacy have influenced debates over university curricula, particularly in their critiques of what they perceive as an overemphasis on race, class, and gender in academic courses.

## Conclusion
The National Association of Scholars plays a significant role in promoting conservative values and traditional liberal arts education in higher education. Its advocacy and research efforts have influenced policy discussions and academic practices. However, its strong ideological stance and potential for political bias highlight the need for careful consideration of its recommendations and the diversity of viewpoints it presents.
