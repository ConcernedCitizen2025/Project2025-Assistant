# National Association of Scholars (NAS)

## Overview
The National Association of Scholars (NAS) is a conservative non-profit organization established in 1987. It aims to reform higher education by promoting the standards of a liberal arts education that fosters intellectual freedom, truth-seeking, and virtuous citizenship. NAS operates through individual advocacy, research reports, and public advocacy to defend academic freedom and integrity ([NAS](https://www.nas.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Scholars)).

## Mission and Activities
NAS's mission is to promote intellectual freedom and uphold the standards of a liberal arts education. Key activities include:
- **Publishing In-Depth Reports:** NAS investigates and critiques contemporary academic practices. Examples include reports on curriculum reform and academic freedom ([NAS](https://www.nas.org), [InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).
- **Advocacy Efforts:** The organization influences education policy and protects academic freedom by filing amicus briefs in legal cases and testifying before legislative committees ([SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org), [InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).
- **Publications:** NAS publishes the quarterly journal *Academic Questions*, which explores issues in higher education, including politics, ideology, scholarship, and teaching ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Scholars)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Peter W. Wood:** President of NAS. Wood has been an influential voice in conservative education circles, advocating for traditional liberal arts education and opposing what he views as the politicization of higher education ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Scholars), [NAS](https://www.nas.org)).
- **Stanley Young:** Director of the Shifting Sands Project, which focuses on applied statistics. Young has a significant background in the pharmaceutical industry and environmental policy ([NAS](https://www.nas.org)).
- **Neetu Arnold:** Research Fellow known for her reports on higher education costs and campus culture, highlighting issues such as administrative bloat and curriculum changes ([NAS](https://www.nas.org)).

## Connections to Trump
NAS is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative designed to prepare conservative policy proposals for future Republican administrations. This connection underscores NAS's role in shaping conservative educational policy and its alignment with broader conservative agendas ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Scholars)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** NAS is considered right-biased, advocating for conservative educational perspectives and often criticizing progressive academic policies. This bias has raised questions about the objectivity of its research and the balance of viewpoints it presents ([Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com), [SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org)).
- **Analysis:** While NAS promotes intellectual freedom and academic integrity, its conservative stance may limit the diversity of perspectives in its publications and advocacy efforts ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).
- **Controversies:** NAS has faced criticism for its reports and positions that oppose multiculturalism and diversity initiatives in higher education. Critics argue that such positions can undermine efforts to create inclusive and equitable academic environments ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Scholars)).

## Conclusion
The National Association of Scholars plays a significant role in promoting conservative values and traditional liberal arts education in higher education. Its advocacy and research efforts have influenced policy discussions and academic practices. However, its strong ideological stance and the potential for political bias highlight the need for careful consideration of its recommendations and the diversity of viewpoints it presents ([NAS](https://www.nas.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Scholars), [Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com)).
