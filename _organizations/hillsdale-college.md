# Hillsdale College

## Overview
Hillsdale College is a private, conservative, Christian liberal arts college located in Hillsdale, Michigan. Founded in 1844, the college is known for its classical liberal arts curriculum, which is grounded in Judeo-Christian values and the principles of the U.S. Constitution. Hillsdale operates independently of government funding, allowing it to maintain its educational philosophy without federal interference.

## Mission and Activities
Hillsdale College’s mission is to provide an education that develops minds and improves hearts by focusing on the best of Western heritage and the Judeo-Christian tradition. Key activities include:
- **Classical Liberal Arts Education:** Hillsdale offers a rigorous curriculum that includes courses on the Great Books, the U.S. Constitution, and Western civilization.
- **Educational Outreach:** The college offers free online courses and operates the Hillsdale Academy, which promotes classical education for K-12 students.
- **Centers and Programs:** Hillsdale runs several influential programs, including the Allan P. Kirby, Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship in Washington, D.C., which serves as a hub for conservative education and outreach.

## Leadership and Influence
- **Larry P. Arnn:** President of Hillsdale College since 2000, Arnn has been a vocal advocate for classical education and conservative principles. He was appointed by President Trump to chair the 1776 Commission, which aimed to promote patriotic education.
- **David Whalen:** Provost of Hillsdale College, overseeing the college's academic programs and curriculum, supporting its commitment to classical liberal arts education.
- **Matthew Spalding:** Vice President of Washington Operations and Dean of the Van Andel Graduate School of Government. Spalding played a key role in the 1776 Commission and is influential in conservative circles, particularly in Washington, D.C.
- **Michael Anton:** A former Trump administration official, Anton joined Hillsdale’s Kirby Center after serving in the National Security Council. He is known for his essay "The Flight 93 Election," which argued for Trump's election in 2016.

## Connections to Trump
Hillsdale College has maintained strong connections with the Trump administration. Leaders like Larry Arnn and Matthew Spalding were directly involved in the 1776 Commission, which aimed to counter progressive narratives in education. Additionally, several Hillsdale alumni have held influential positions within the Trump administration, further solidifying the college's influence in shaping conservative educational policies.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias in Education:** Hillsdale’s strong emphasis on conservative and patriotic education, particularly through initiatives like the 1776 Commission and its curriculum offerings, has raised concerns about the objectivity and inclusivity of its educational programs.
- **Involvement in Election Controversies:** Attorneys associated with Hillsdale College were reportedly involved in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, further highlighting the college's deep ties to the Trump administration.

## Conclusion
Hillsdale College plays a significant role in promoting conservative values through its classical liberal arts education and involvement in national educational initiatives like the 1776 Commission. Its connections to the Trump administration highlight its influence in shaping conservative educational policies. However, its strong ideological stance and involvement in political controversies raise questions about the inclusivity and diversity of perspectives within its educational framework.
