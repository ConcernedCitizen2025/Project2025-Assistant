# Hillsdale College

## Overview
Hillsdale College is a private, conservative, Christian liberal arts college located in Hillsdale, Michigan. Founded in 1844, the college is renowned for its classical liberal arts curriculum, which is grounded in Judeo-Christian values and the principles of the U.S. Constitution. It operates independently of government funding, allowing it to maintain its educational philosophy without federal interference ([Hillsdale College](https://www.hillsdale.edu), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsdale_College)).

## Mission and Activities
Hillsdale College’s mission is to provide an education that develops minds and improves hearts by focusing on the best of Western heritage and the Judeo-Christian tradition. Key activities include:
- **Classical Liberal Arts Education:** Hillsdale offers a rigorous curriculum that includes courses on the Great Books, the U.S. Constitution, and Western civilization ([Hillsdale College](https://www.hillsdale.edu)).
- **Educational Outreach:** The college offers free online courses and operates the Hillsdale Academy, which promotes classical education for K-12 students ([Hillsdale College](https://www.hillsdale.edu)).
- **Centers and Programs:** Includes the Allan P. Kirby, Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship, the Center for Constructive Alternatives, and the Van Andel Graduate School of Statesmanship ([Hillsdale College](https://www.hillsdale.edu)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Larry P. Arnn:** President of Hillsdale College since 2000, Arnn has been a strong advocate for classical education and conservative principles. He was a member of President Trump’s 1776 Commission, which aimed to promote patriotic education ([Hillsdale College](https://www.hillsdale.edu)).
- **David Whalen:** Provost, overseeing academic programs and curriculum. Whalen’s work supports the college’s commitment to a classical liberal arts education ([Hillsdale College](https://www.hillsdale.edu)).
- **Matthew Spalding:** Vice President of Washington Operations and Dean of the Van Andel Graduate School of Government. Spalding served as the Executive Director of the 1776 Commission ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsdale_College)).

## Connections to Trump
Hillsdale College has maintained strong connections with the Trump administration. Key leaders, such as Larry Arnn and Matthew Spalding, were directly involved in the 1776 Commission, which aimed to counter progressive narratives in education. These connections illustrate Hillsdale’s influence in shaping conservative educational policies ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsdale_College)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias in Education:** The college’s strong emphasis on conservative and patriotic education, especially through initiatives like the 1776 Commission, may raise concerns about the objectivity and inclusivity of its educational programs ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsdale_College)).

## Conclusion
Hillsdale College plays a significant role in promoting conservative values through its classical liberal arts education and involvement in national educational initiatives like the 1776 Commission. Its connections to the Trump administration highlight its influence in shaping conservative educational policies. However, its strong ideological stance raises questions about the inclusivity and diversity of perspectives within its educational framework ([Hillsdale College](https://www.hillsdale.edu), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsdale_College)).
