# American Principles Project

## Overview
The American Principles Project (APP) is a conservative organization founded in 2009 by Robert P. George, Jeff Bell, and Francis P. Cannon. The organization aims to make the family the most powerful and well-represented special interest group in Washington, D.C. APP is heavily involved in political advocacy, focusing on issues like opposition to transgender rights, abortion, and diversity programs. The organization is also engaged in direct political campaigns, often using its super PAC to influence elections in favor of candidates who align with its pro-family values.

## Mission and Activities
APP's mission is to defend the family as society's most important institution and its greatest safeguard of human dignity. The organization advocates for policy solutions that protect the rights of families and works to impose political costs on those who attack family values. Key activities include:
- **Campaigns and Elections:** APP engages in political campaigns to support candidates who defend family values, particularly focusing on issues like transgender healthcare, the Equality Act, and abortion. The organization’s super PAC is known for funding aggressive and sometimes controversial campaign ads.
- **Policy Advocacy:** APP works on various issues, including opposing the Equality Act and advocating for restrictive immigration and pro-family economic policies. The organization’s policy positions often align with broader conservative agendas, and it has been particularly vocal in its opposition to LGBTQ rights and gender-affirming care.

## Leadership and Influence
- **Terry Schilling:** President of APP, Schilling oversees strategy, messaging, and political activity at the state and federal levels. Under his leadership, APP has grown into a prominent national organization advocating for conservative family values. Schilling has a background in political campaign management and is a vocal opponent of transgender healthcare and the Equality Act.
- **Jon Schweppe:** Director of Policy, Schweppe is responsible for advancing APP's legislative priorities and has co-authored significant reports on free speech and children's protection. He has a strong background in communications and policy within conservative circles.
- **Anthony LaBruna:** Executive Director, LaBruna previously worked at the White House during the Trump administration and has served in various political roles. His experience in government and politics is crucial for APP’s strategic initiatives.

## Connections to Trump
APP has established strong connections with the Trump administration and other conservative figures. The organization is a key participant in Project 2025, an initiative by the Heritage Foundation designed to shape policy for a future conservative administration. APP’s involvement in this project, alongside its deep ties to Trump-aligned figures, suggests its significant influence on shaping policy directions in line with Trump-era values.

## Concerns
- **Aggressive Advocacy:** APP’s direct engagement in political campaigns and its strong stance on controversial issues like transgender healthcare and the Equality Act may deepen political and social divisions. The organization’s aggressive tactics, including the use of misleading campaign ads, have drawn significant criticism.
- **Influence on Administration:** APP's role in Project 2025 and its connections to Trump-aligned figures raise concerns about biased policymaking that may prioritize conservative agendas over a balanced approach to governance. The organization’s influence on future policy directions is likely to be substantial, given its alignment with conservative and Trump-era values.

## Conclusion
The American Principles Project plays a critical role in advocating for conservative family values in American politics. While its mission to defend the family is significant, the organization’s aggressive advocacy and strong ties to the Trump administration warrant careful scrutiny. The American public must be informed about these developments to understand their broader implications for national policy and social cohesion.
