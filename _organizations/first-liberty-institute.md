# First Liberty Institute

## Overview
First Liberty Institute is a non-profit conservative legal organization based in Plano, Texas, dedicated to defending religious freedom for all Americans. Founded in 1997 by Kelly Shackelford, the institute focuses exclusively on First Amendment cases related to religious liberty. First Liberty's mission is to protect the fundamental right to follow one's faith and conscience without government interference ([First Liberty](https://firstliberty.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Liberty_Institute)).

## Mission and Activities
First Liberty's mission is to defend and restore religious liberty across the United States. Key activities include:
- **Legal Defense:** Providing pro bono legal representation in cases involving religious freedom, often taking cases to the Supreme Court to set legal precedents ([First Liberty](https://firstliberty.org)).
- **Public Education:** Producing educational materials, conducting media outreach, and hosting events to raise awareness about religious liberty issues ([First Liberty](https://firstliberty.org)).
- **Policy Advocacy:** Engaging in policy discussions and advocating for laws that protect religious freedoms at both state and federal levels ([First Liberty](https://firstliberty.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Kelly Shackelford:** Founder, President, and CEO of First Liberty Institute, Shackelford is a constitutional scholar with over three decades of experience in defending religious freedom. He has argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and has been a prominent voice in the legal community on First Amendment issues ([First Liberty](https://firstliberty.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Shackelford)).
- **Jeff Mateer:** Chief Legal Officer, Mateer oversees First Liberty's legal operations and has extensive experience in religious liberty litigation. He rejoined the institute in 2020 after serving as the First Assistant Attorney General of Texas ([First Liberty](https://firstliberty.org)).

## Connections to Trump
First Liberty has maintained strong connections with the Trump administration, influencing policies related to religious freedom. Notably, several individuals associated with First Liberty, including Ken Klukowski and Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, have held significant positions within the administration or were nominated to federal judicial positions by President Trump ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Liberty_Institute)).

## Concerns
- **Controversial Stances:** First Liberty has been involved in several high-profile cases that have drawn significant attention and controversy. For instance, the 'Candy Cane Case' and its stance on public displays of religion have been points of contention ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Liberty_Institute)).
- **Potential Bias:** The organization's close ties to conservative political figures and its involvement in high-stakes political battles raise questions about the potential influence of partisan interests on its advocacy for religious liberty ([First Liberty](https://firstliberty.org)).

## Conclusion
First Liberty Institute plays a critical role in defending religious freedom in the United States. Its legal victories have set important precedents in the protection of First Amendment rights. However, the organization's controversial stances and connections to conservative politics warrant careful scrutiny to ensure that its advocacy efforts remain focused on genuine issues of religious liberty ([First Liberty](https://firstliberty.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Liberty_Institute)).
