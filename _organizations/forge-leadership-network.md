# Forge Leadership Network (FLN)

## Overview
The Forge Leadership Network (FLN) is a conservative organization founded in 2015, co-founded by Adam Josefczyk and Justin Powell in Dayton, Ohio. The organization is dedicated to mentoring and training young conservative leaders aged 18-25. FLN aims to equip the next generation of leaders in politics, culture, and business by promoting principles such as limited government, Judeo-Christian ethics, and economic freedom. The network provides a platform for young conservatives to connect with influential leaders and gain practical experience in the political and cultural arenas.

## Mission and Activities
FLN’s mission is realized through its two primary programs:
- **Forge Leadership Summit:** A five-day intensive program featuring training sessions, professional development, and talks from leading conservative figures. Participants engage in activities like mock political campaigns and legislative simulations, which serve as the entry point to the Forge Mentorship Academy.
- **Forge Mentorship Academy:** A year-long program that offers experiential learning in politics, training in argumentation, and networking opportunities. The academy includes trips to Washington, D.C., and Israel, providing participants with exposure to both national and international political processes.

## Leadership and Influence
- **Adam Josefczyk:** Co-Founder and President of FLN, Josefczyk has a background in public policy and grassroots political efforts. Before founding FLN, he co-founded the Ohio Conservative Review and was involved in various conservative advocacy roles. His leadership has been crucial in shaping FLN’s mission and expanding its reach.
- **Brad Gruber:** Chief Operating Officer of FLN, Gruber manages the day-to-day operations of the organization. His previous experience includes serving as COO of the State Policy Network and involvement in nonprofit boards, as well as his military service as an officer in the U.S. Air Force.
- **Jeremiah Martin:** Vice President of Programs at FLN, Martin is a U.S. Army veteran with extensive experience in conservative advocacy, including previous roles with the Center for Christian Virtue and Concerned Veterans for America.

## Connections to Trump
FLN has developed connections with influential conservative organizations and figures aligned with the Trump administration's values, including the Heritage Foundation and the Alliance Defending Freedom. The network's activities and partnerships highlight its integration into the broader conservative movement, aligning closely with the America-first agenda promoted during Trump's presidency.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** FLN’s strong conservative orientation and its connections to right-wing organizations could suggest a potential bias in its training and advocacy efforts, which may limit the diversity of perspectives presented to participants.
- **Lobbying Activities:** Concerns have been raised about FLN's activities potentially crossing into lobbying, especially in advancing model legislation and candidate briefings. This could challenge its non-profit status if these activities are deemed to exceed the permissible scope of a tax-exempt organization.

## Conclusion
The Forge Leadership Network is an influential organization in training and mentoring young conservative leaders in the U.S. Its programs are designed to prepare participants for roles in politics, culture, and business rooted in conservative principles. However, its strong ideological stance and potential lobbying activities warrant careful scrutiny to ensure a balanced and legal approach to its advocacy.
