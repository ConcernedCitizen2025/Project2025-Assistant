# American Cornerstone Institute

## Overview
The American Cornerstone Institute (ACI) is a conservative nonprofit organization founded in 2021 by Dr. Ben Carson, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Trump. ACI promotes conservative values centered around four foundational principles: faith, liberty, community, and life. The organization is dedicated to addressing America’s most pressing issues through educational initiatives, policy advocacy, and community engagement, all guided by a faith-based approach ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org), [SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org)).

## Mission and Activities
ACI’s mission is to educate Americans on foundational principles and foster national unity. Key activities include:
- **Education:** ACI produces research and educational content on critical issues, including economic liberty, Supreme Court cases, and the significance of founding documents. Notable initiatives include the *More Perfect Union Project*, which emphasizes the importance of America's founding principles, and the *Little Patriots Program*, which provides resources to educate children on civics and American values ([American Cornerstone Institute](https://www.americancornerstone.org)).
- **Outreach:** The institute actively engages with community leaders and faith-based organizations to promote voter registration and strengthen local communities. ACI believes that grassroots efforts and strong communities are more effective than government intervention in solving national challenges ([American Cornerstone Institute](https://www.americancornerstone.org)).
- **Collaboration:** ACI partners with other conservative and faith-based organizations to amplify their collective impact and address national challenges. This collaborative approach is designed to empower the conservative movement to achieve significant results ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Dr. Ben Carson:** Founder and Chairman, Carson leverages his experience in medicine and government to guide ACI’s policy and advocacy efforts. His focus is on promoting practical and faith-based solutions to the nation's challenges.
- **Dr. Alma Golden:** Chief Operating Officer, Golden brings extensive experience in healthcare policy and administration, contributing to ACI’s strategic initiatives.
- **Eric Blankenstein:** Director of Policy, Blankenstein has a background in federal oversight and has been involved in shaping ACI's policy agenda ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org), [SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org)).

## Connections to Trump
ACI has strong ties to the Trump administration through Dr. Ben Carson’s role as Secretary of HUD. The organization’s policy positions often align with the broader conservative agenda promoted by Trump, particularly in areas such as limited government and traditional values. Carson's leadership at ACI reflects the continuation of the conservative ideals he championed during his tenure in the Trump administration ([SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org), [American Cornerstone Institute](https://www.americancornerstone.org)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** ACI’s strong conservative orientation may influence the objectivity of its educational and policy efforts. Its close ties to conservative figures and emphasis on faith-based values could limit the diversity of perspectives in its initiatives ([Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com)).
- **Focus on Non-Controversial Issues:** While ACI addresses significant societal challenges, its avoidance of more divisive issues might limit its impact on broader policy debates. This focus on less controversial topics could be seen as a way to avoid deeper conflicts within the conservative movement ([SourceWatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org)).

## Conclusion
The American Cornerstone Institute plays a pivotal role in promoting conservative values and education in the United States. Its initiatives aim to strengthen national unity and address key issues through faith-based and community-driven approaches. However, its strong ideological stance and potential biases warrant careful consideration of its educational content and policy recommendations ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org), [American Cornerstone Institute](https://www.americancornerstone.org)).
