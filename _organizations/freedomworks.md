# FreedomWorks

## Overview
FreedomWorks was a conservative and libertarian advocacy group founded in 1984, known for its emphasis on free-market principles, limited government, and individual liberty. Based in Washington, D.C., the organization played a significant role in promoting the Tea Party movement and influencing economic and regulatory policies during the Trump administration. However, internal and external challenges, particularly during the Trump era, led to its closure in May 2024.

## Mission and Activities
FreedomWorks' mission was to advance free-market principles and reduce government intervention through various initiatives:
- **Research and Analysis:** The organization published reports on economic policy, regulatory reform, and government spending, advocating for lower taxes, reduced regulation, and free-market solutions.
- **Public Policy Advocacy:** FreedomWorks engaged with policymakers and the public to influence legislative outcomes, focusing on issues like school choice, tax reform, and opposition to Obamacare.
- **Grassroots Activism:** Known for mobilizing grassroots activists, FreedomWorks organized campaigns, events, and training programs designed to influence public policy and elections.

## Leadership and Influence
- **[Adam Brandon](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/freedomworks-radical-rebrand-00115437):** President of FreedomWorks during its later years, Brandon guided the organization through a tumultuous period marked by the rise of Trump-aligned populism. His leadership was central to the organization's strategy but also highlighted the growing ideological divide within its ranks.
- **[Stephen Moore](/authors/stephen-moore.html):** A Senior Economic Contributor, Moore was closely associated with Trump's economic policies and was known for advocating free-market principles and regulatory reform.
- **[Matt Kibbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Kibbe):** Former President and CEO, Kibbe was instrumental in shaping the organization during its peak influence in the Tea Party era. He left amid internal conflicts over the direction of the organization.

## Connections to Trump
FreedomWorks had significant influence within the Trump administration, particularly in areas related to deregulation, tax policy, and opposition to the Affordable Care Act. The organization's positions often aligned with Trump's economic agenda, though internal conflicts over the direction of the conservative movement ultimately contributed to its dissolution.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** The organization faced criticism for its libertarian agenda, with some arguing that its advocacy efforts were influenced by ideological bias rather than objective analysis.
- **Controversial Positions:** FreedomWorks' stance on deregulation and limited government intervention was often contentious, particularly in the context of economic policy debates and its role in promoting the Tea Party movement.

## Conclusion
FreedomWorks was a significant force in promoting conservative and libertarian principles in U.S. politics. Its role in shaping public discourse and influencing policy, especially during the Trump administration, was substantial. However, the organization's internal divisions and the shifting dynamics within the conservative movement ultimately led to its closure in 2024. Despite its dissolution, FreedomWorks' impact on American political culture, particularly through the Tea Party movement, remains a notable chapter in recent political history.
