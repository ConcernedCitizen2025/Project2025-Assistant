# James Madison Institute (JMI)

## Overview
The James Madison Institute (JMI) is a nonpartisan research and educational organization founded in 1987 and based in Tallahassee, Florida. The institute is dedicated to promoting the principles of limited government, economic freedom, federalism, and individual liberty. JMI plays a key role in shaping public policy in Florida, focusing on areas such as economic freedom, education, healthcare, and regulatory reform.

## Mission and Activities
JMI's mission is to advocate for free-market policies and limited government intervention. Key activities include:
- **Conducting Research:** The institute conducts rigorous research on various issues, including criminal justice, healthcare, taxes, and regulatory environments, to inform policy decisions at the state and national levels.
- **Public Engagement:** JMI engages with the public and policymakers through publications, events, and educational programs aimed at promoting free-market principles. The organization also runs several policy centers that focus on specific issues like economic prosperity and educational options.
- **Policy Influence:** JMI plays a significant role in influencing policy, particularly in Florida, by providing research and recommendations that align with its principles of limited government and economic freedom.

## Connections to Trump
JMI is listed as an advisory board member of Project 2025, an initiative by the Heritage Foundation aimed at shaping conservative policy for future Republican administrations. This connection highlights JMI's alignment with broader conservative agendas, including those supported by Trump and his affiliates.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** JMI's strong advocacy for free-market principles and limited government may lead to concerns about potential biases in its research and policy recommendations. The organization's alignment with conservative agendas could influence its objectivity.
- **Influence on Policy:** JMI's significant role in shaping state policy, particularly in Florida, underscores the importance of scrutinizing its recommendations to ensure they serve the public interest.

## Conclusion
The James Madison Institute is a key player in promoting conservative values and free-market principles in Florida and across the United States. Its research and advocacy efforts have a considerable impact on public policy, particularly in areas such as economic freedom, education, and regulatory reform. However, its strong ideological stance and connections to conservative movements warrant careful consideration of its policy recommendations and research outputs.
