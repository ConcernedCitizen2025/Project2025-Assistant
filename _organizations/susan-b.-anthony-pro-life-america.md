# Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America

## Overview
Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, formerly known as Susan B. Anthony List, is a nonprofit organization founded in 1992 that seeks to end abortion in the United States by electing national leaders and advocating for laws that protect unborn lives. The organization is particularly focused on promoting pro-life women leaders and engaging in both federal and state-level policy advocacy.

## Mission and Activities

## Connections to Trump
Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America has strong connections to the Trump administration. The organization has consistently supported Trump due to his alignment with their pro-life agenda, despite recent disagreements over specific policies like federal abortion restrictions. SBA's advocacy work and strategic initiatives have significantly influenced both Trump’s policy positions and the broader conservative approach to abortion laws.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** The organization's focus on conservative pro-life advocacy has led to concerns about inclusivity and the diversity of its perspectives. Critics argue that this focus could polarize public discourse on reproductive rights.
- **Controversial Positions:** SBA Pro-Life America’s aggressive stance on restrictive abortion laws has sparked significant debate over women’s reproductive rights and health. The use of Susan B. Anthony's name has also led to disputes regarding her actual stance on abortion.

## Conclusion
Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America is a leading force in the pro-life movement, known for its robust political and legislative advocacy. Its efforts to elect pro-life leaders and advance restrictive abortion laws reflect its deep commitment to its mission. However, the organization’s strong political bias and controversial positions on reproductive rights warrant careful scrutiny and balanced consideration.
