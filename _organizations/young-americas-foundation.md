# Young America's Foundation (YAF)

## Overview
Young America's Foundation (YAF), founded in 1969, is a prominent conservative youth organization dedicated to promoting individual freedom, a strong national defense, free enterprise, and traditional values among young Americans. YAF influences conservative thought on college campuses through educational programs, speaker series, and conferences. The organization also manages Ronald Reagan's **Rancho del Cielo**, acquired in 1998 to preserve Reagan's legacy and educate about conservative principles.

## Mission and Activities
YAF’s mission is to inspire young Americans with conservative ideas. Key activities include:
- **Educational Conferences and Seminars:** Hosting events like the National Conservative Student Conference to provide students with opportunities to learn from leading conservative figures.
- **Speaker Programs:** Bringing prominent conservative speakers, such as Ben Shapiro and Newt Gingrich, to college campuses, often sparking significant debate and controversy.
- **Campus Initiatives:** Supporting conservative activism through Young Americans for Freedom chapters, offering resources and organizational support to students.

## Leadership and Influence
- **Scott Walker:** Former Governor of Wisconsin and YAF President since 2021, Walker aims to broaden YAF’s reach to more high schools and even junior high students, focusing on free speech and "objective" history and economics education&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- **Ron Robinson:** Walker’s predecessor, Robinson served as YAF president for 43 years and helped expand YAF’s influence, including acquiring the Reagan Ranch in 1998&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## Connections to Trump
YAF has occasionally aligned with the broader conservative movement supported by Trump, featuring prominent Trump allies as speakers at its events. However, YAF's focus remains largely on its broader mission of promoting conservative principles among youth, beyond direct Trump endorsements&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** YAF's emphasis on promoting conservative values raises concerns about limiting exposure to diverse viewpoints. Critics argue that its initiatives contribute to polarization on college campuses.
- **Free Speech Advocacy:** While YAF advocates for free speech, its critics claim that its focus on conservative speakers might overshadow the promotion of a truly balanced discourse&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
