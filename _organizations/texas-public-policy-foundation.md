# Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF)

## Overview
The Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF) is a non-profit, non-partisan research institute founded in 1989 and based in Austin, Texas. TPPF is dedicated to promoting and defending liberty, personal responsibility, and free enterprise through research and advocacy. The organization is influential in shaping conservative public policy, particularly in Texas, with a focus on deregulation, education reform, and economic freedom.

## Mission and Activities
TPPF's mission is to advance policies that enhance liberty and economic freedom in Texas and nationwide. Key activities include:
- **Policy Research:** TPPF conducts research on various policy issues, including healthcare, education, energy, and economic regulation, advocating for limited government intervention and free-market solutions.
- **Advocacy:** The foundation engages in legislative testimony, public outreach, and media campaigns to promote conservative policy solutions. It has been particularly effective in influencing state-level policy in Texas.
- **Educational Outreach:** TPPF provides educational resources and hosts events to inform the public and policymakers about free-market principles, often collaborating with other conservative organizations.

## Leadership and Influence
- **Greg Sindelar:** CEO of TPPF, Sindelar has been instrumental in expanding the foundation's influence on public policy through rigorous research and strategic advocacy.
- **Kevin Roberts:** Former Executive Director, Roberts was pivotal in guiding TPPF's growth before moving to a leadership role at the Heritage Foundation, laying the groundwork for TPPF's current strategies.

## Connections to Trump
TPPF has notable connections to the Trump administration, particularly through its involvement in Project 2025, an initiative led by the Heritage Foundation to prepare conservative policy proposals for future Republican administrations. TPPF's advocacy for deregulation and free-market policies aligns closely with Trump's economic agenda.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** TPPF's conservative stance may influence the objectivity of its research and advocacy efforts. Critics argue that its ideological focus could affect the balance of its policy recommendations.
- **Controversial Stances:** TPPF has been involved in debates over climate change policy, often opposing regulations aimed at addressing environmental concerns, which has sparked controversy.

## Conclusion
The Texas Public Policy Foundation is a significant conservative think tank that plays a vital role in shaping policy in Texas and beyond. Its extensive research and advocacy efforts influence public policy debates, particularly in areas such as economic freedom and deregulation. However, its strong ideological orientation and connections to conservative movements, including the Trump administration, necessitate careful consideration of its policy recommendations and research outputs.
