# Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF)

## Overview
The Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF) is a non-profit, non-partisan research institute founded in 1989 and based in Austin, Texas. TPPF is dedicated to promoting and defending liberty, personal responsibility, and free enterprise through its research and outreach efforts. The organization focuses on influencing policymakers and public debate by providing academically sound research and effective advocacy ([TPPF](https://www.texaspolicy.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Public_Policy_Foundation)).

## Mission and Activities
TPPF's mission is to promote policies that enhance liberty and economic freedom in Texas and across the nation. Key activities include:
- **Policy Research:** TPPF conducts research on various policy issues, including healthcare, education, energy, the environment, and economic regulation. Its work often advocates for deregulation and free-market solutions ([TPPF](https://www.texaspolicy.com)).
- **Advocacy:** The organization engages in legislative testimony, public outreach, and media campaigns to promote conservative policy solutions. It is particularly active in influencing state-level policy in Texas ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).
- **Educational Outreach:** TPPF provides educational resources and hosts events to inform the public and policymakers about free-market principles, often collaborating with other conservative organizations ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Public_Policy_Foundation)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Greg Sindelar:** CEO of TPPF, Sindelar has played a crucial role in expanding the organization's influence on public policy through rigorous research and strategic advocacy ([TPPF](https://www.texaspolicy.com)).
- **Kevin Roberts:** Former Executive Director, Roberts significantly contributed to TPPF's direction and growth before moving to a leadership role at the Heritage Foundation. His work at TPPF laid the groundwork for its current strategies ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).

## Connections to Trump
TPPF has notable connections to the Trump administration, particularly through its involvement in Project 2025, an initiative led by the Heritage Foundation to prepare conservative policy proposals for future Republican administrations. TPPF's advocacy for deregulation and free-market policies aligns closely with Trump's economic agenda ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Public_Policy_Foundation), [InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** TPPF is known for its conservative stance, which may influence the objectivity of its research and advocacy efforts. Critics argue that its strong ideological focus could affect the balance of its policy recommendations ([Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com)).
- **Controversial Stances:** TPPF has been involved in debates over climate change policy, often opposing regulations that address environmental concerns. This position has sparked controversy and criticism from environmental advocates ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Public_Policy_Foundation)).

## Conclusion
The Texas Public Policy Foundation is a significant conservative think tank that plays a vital role in shaping policy in Texas and beyond. Its extensive research and advocacy efforts influence public policy debates, particularly in areas such as economic freedom and deregulation. However, its strong ideological orientation and connections to conservative movements, including the Trump administration, necessitate careful consideration of its policy recommendations and research outputs ([TPPF](https://www.texaspolicy.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Public_Policy_Foundation)).
