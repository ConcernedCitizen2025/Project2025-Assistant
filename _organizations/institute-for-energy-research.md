# Institute for Energy Research (IER)

## Overview
The Institute for Energy Research (IER) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1989, based in Washington, D.C., that conducts research and analysis on global energy markets. IER advocates for free-market energy policies, emphasizing that minimally regulated energy markets provide the most efficient solutions to global energy and environmental challenges. The organization has been influential in shaping energy policy debates, particularly in its opposition to regulatory measures aimed at addressing climate change.

## Mission and Activities
IER's mission is to inform policymakers, the media, and the public about energy and environmental issues through research and analysis that support free-market principles. Key activities include:
- **Policy Advocacy:** IER promotes policies favoring deregulation and the expansion of fossil fuels. The organization frequently opposes government interventions such as emissions trading, renewable energy mandates, and efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
- **Research and Publications:** IER produces reports and analyses on energy policy, market trends, and environmental regulations. The organization is known for questioning the scientific consensus on climate change and criticizing efforts aimed at transitioning to renewable energy.
- **Public Engagement:** IER engages with the public and policymakers through events, briefings, and digital content, aiming to influence energy policy discussions in favor of fossil fuel expansion.

## Leadership and Influence
- **Robert L. Bradley Jr.:** Founder and CEO of IER, Bradley is a prominent advocate for free-market energy policies. He has authored several books on energy policy and is associated with multiple conservative think tanks.
- **Thomas J. Pyle:** President of IER and its political arm, the American Energy Alliance (AEA). Pyle played a significant role in the Trump administration as a member of the Department of Energy transition team, where he promoted a fossil fuel-friendly agenda.
- **Daniel Kish:** Senior Vice President of Policy, Kish has extensive experience in energy policy and is a vocal critic of environmental regulations that he views as detrimental to the energy sector.
- **Steven F. Hayward:** Board member, Hayward is a visiting professor at Pepperdine University and has written extensively on environmental policy.

## Connections to Trump
IER has strong connections to the Trump administration, particularly through Thomas Pyle’s involvement in the Department of Energy’s transition team. The organization's policy recommendations, which often favor the fossil fuel industry, closely align with Trump’s energy policies, including the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and the rollback of environmental regulations.

## Concerns
- **Climate Change Denial:** IER is widely recognized as a leading organization that questions the scientific consensus on climate change. Critics argue that its stance undermines global efforts to combat climate change and reflects the interests of its fossil fuel industry donors.
- **Fossil Fuel Industry Ties:** IER has received significant funding from fossil fuel entities such as ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute. This financial support has led to accusations that IER’s research is biased in favor of the fossil fuel industry.

## Conclusion
The Institute for Energy Research plays a significant role in shaping energy policy from a free-market perspective. Its strong ties to the Trump administration and fossil fuel industry, along with its controversial stance on climate change, underscore the need for careful scrutiny of its research and policy recommendations.
