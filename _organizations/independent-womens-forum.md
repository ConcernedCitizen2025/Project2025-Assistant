# Independent Women's Forum (IWF)

## Overview
The Independent Women's Forum (IWF) is a conservative non-profit organization founded in 1992. Initially established in response to the Supreme Court nomination of Clarence Thomas, IWF has positioned itself as a counter to mainstream feminist organizations. The group advocates for policies emphasizing economic liberty, personal responsibility, and limited government intervention. Over the years, IWF has grown significantly, becoming a prominent voice in conservative circles, particularly on issues related to women's rights, healthcare, and education.

## Mission and Activities
IWF's mission is to improve the lives of Americans by increasing the number of women who value free markets and personal liberty. Key activities include:
- **Policy Advocacy:** IWF promotes conservative positions on healthcare, education, and economic policy. It opposes mainstream feminist stances, advocating instead for "equity feminism," which focuses on equal opportunity rather than equal outcomes.
- **Educational Outreach:** The organization conducts research, publishes articles, and hosts events to educate the public and policymakers on conservative perspectives. IWF has been active in campaigns against certain regulations, such as those on vaping and gun control.
- **Legal Advocacy:** Through the Independent Women’s Law Center, IWF engages in legal battles to protect free speech and challenge policies it views as discriminatory against women or restrictive of individual liberty.

## Leadership and Influence

- **[Heather R. Higgins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Higgins):** Chairman of the Board, Higgins plays a crucial role in IWF's strategic direction. She also leads the Independent Women's Voice (IWV), a politically active sister organization focusing on electoral advocacy.

- **Larry Kudlow:** Former Director of the National Economic Council under President Trump, Kudlow’s involvement with IWF highlights the organization’s ties to conservative economic policies and the Trump administration.

## Connections to Trump
IWF has maintained strong connections with the Trump administration, particularly through figures like Larry Kudlow and other conservative leaders associated with the organization. IWF’s advocacy on issues such as healthcare and education aligns closely with Trump’s agenda, emphasizing deregulation, free-market principles, and state-level governance over federal oversight.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** IWF has been criticized for promoting a conservative agenda under the guise of non-partisan advocacy. Critics argue that the organization’s positions, especially on issues like reproductive rights and gender equality, may not represent the diversity of women’s views and could marginalize more progressive perspectives.
- **Influence of Corporate Funding:** IWF has faced scrutiny for receiving funding from corporate interests, including tobacco and fossil fuel industries, which may influence its advocacy against regulations in these areas.

## Conclusion
The Independent Women’s Forum plays a significant role in conservative advocacy, focusing on policies that enhance economic liberty and personal responsibility. While its leadership and connections to the Trump administration underscore its influence, the organization’s strong ideological stance and potential lack of inclusivity raise concerns that warrant careful consideration.
