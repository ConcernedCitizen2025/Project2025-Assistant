# Family Research Council (FRC)

## Overview
The Family Research Council (FRC) is a conservative evangelical advocacy group and think tank established in 1981 by James Dobson. Based in Washington, D.C., FRC focuses on promoting what it describes as family values, which include opposition to abortion, divorce, LGBTQ rights, and pornography. The organization emphasizes the importance of a biblical worldview in shaping public policy. Over the years, FRC has been a significant force in conservative politics, particularly in influencing public policy through advocacy and media engagement ([FRC](https://www.frc.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Research_Council)).

## Mission and Activities
FRC's mission is to champion marriage and family as the foundation of civilization, advocate for the sanctity of human life, and uphold religious liberty. Key activities include:
- **Policy Advocacy:** FRC engages in extensive lobbying and advocacy efforts to influence public policy at federal and state levels, particularly on issues related to life, marriage, family, and religious freedom. The organization is known for its strong stance against LGBTQ rights and has been involved in numerous campaigns and legislative efforts to advance its agenda ([FRC](https://www.frc.org)).
- **Publications and Media:** FRC produces a wide range of reports, articles, and media content to promote its viewpoints. The organization also hosts the "Washington Watch" radio program, where President Tony Perkins discusses current issues from a conservative perspective ([FRC](https://www.frc.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Perkins_(politician))).
- **Conferences and Events:** FRC organizes events like the "Pray Vote Stand" Summit (formerly known as the Values Voter Summit), which brings together conservative leaders and activists to discuss key issues and mobilize support for conservative causes ([SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org), [FRC Action](https://www.frcaction.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Tony Perkins:** President of FRC since 2003, Perkins is a prominent figure in conservative politics. He has been a vocal advocate for FRC’s positions on various social issues, particularly those opposing LGBTQ rights and supporting religious liberty. Perkins also serves as Chairman of FRC Action, the organization's legislative affiliate ([FRC Action](https://www.frcaction.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Perkins_(politician))).
- **Peter Sprigg:** Senior Fellow for Policy Studies, Sprigg has been a significant voice in FRC’s advocacy against LGBTQ rights, often promoting controversial views on homosexuality and same-sex marriage. His public statements have sparked significant criticism from civil rights organizations ([SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org)).

## Connections to Trump
FRC has had strong ties with the Trump administration, supporting many of its policies, particularly those related to religious liberty and anti-abortion measures. The organization played a role in shaping and endorsing several of Trump’s policy initiatives and has been actively involved in Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative aimed at shaping conservative policy for future administrations ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Research_Council), [SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org)).

## Concerns
- **Designation as a Hate Group:** In 2010, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) classified FRC as an anti-LGBTQ hate group due to its promotion of discredited research and false claims about the LGBTQ community. This designation has been highly controversial and has led to significant criticism of FRC's positions and rhetoric ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Research_Council), [SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org)).

## Conclusion
The Family Research Council is a major force in advocating for conservative Christian values in U.S. public policy. While it has a substantial following and influence, its controversial stances on LGBTQ rights and alignment with far-right ideologies necessitate careful scrutiny. As FRC continues to shape public discourse and policy, its impact on social and political landscapes will remain significant ([FRC](https://www.frc.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Research_Council)).
