# Family Research Council (FRC)

## Overview
The Family Research Council (FRC) is a conservative evangelical advocacy group and think tank established in 1981 by James Dobson. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., FRC focuses on promoting traditional family values, including opposition to abortion, LGBTQ rights, and pornography. The organization emphasizes the importance of a biblical worldview in shaping public policy and has been a significant force in conservative politics, particularly in influencing policy debates and public discourse.

## Mission and Activities
FRC's mission is to champion marriage and family as the foundation of civilization, advocate for the sanctity of human life, and uphold religious liberty. Key activities include:
- **Policy Advocacy:** FRC is heavily involved in lobbying and advocating for policies at both federal and state levels, particularly on issues related to life, marriage, family, and religious freedom. The organization is well-known for its staunch opposition to LGBTQ rights and its active involvement in campaigns to restrict abortion.
- **Publications and Media:** FRC produces a wide range of reports, articles, and media content that promote its viewpoints. The organization also hosts the "Washington Watch" radio program, where President Tony Perkins discusses current issues from a conservative perspective.
- **Conferences and Events:** FRC organizes significant events such as the "Pray Vote Stand" Summit (formerly the Values Voter Summit), which gathers conservative leaders and activists to mobilize support for its causes.

## Leadership and Influence
- **[Tony Perkins](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/tony-perkins):** Serving as President of FRC since 2003, Perkins is a prominent figure in conservative politics. He has been a vocal advocate for FRC’s positions on various social issues, particularly those opposing LGBTQ rights and supporting religious liberty. Perkins has also been active in shaping the GOP's platform in recent years, particularly during the Trump administration.
- **[Peter Sprigg](https://www.mediamatters.org/peter-sprigg):** A Senior Fellow for Policy Studies, Sprigg has been a significant voice in FRC’s advocacy, particularly in its opposition to LGBTQ rights and same-sex marriage.

## Connections to Trump
FRC has maintained strong ties with the Trump administration, supporting many of its policies, particularly those related to religious liberty and anti-abortion measures. The organization has been actively involved in efforts to shape the GOP platform to align with Trump’s agenda and continues to be a major player in the conservative movement.

## Concerns
- **Designation as a Hate Group:** In 2010, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) designated FRC as an anti-LGBTQ hate group due to its promotion of discredited research and false claims about the LGBTQ community. This designation has sparked significant controversy and has been a focal point of criticism against the organization.
  
## Conclusion
The Family Research Council is a powerful force in advocating for conservative Christian values in U.S. public policy. While it has a substantial following and influence, its controversial stances on LGBTQ rights and alignment with far-right ideologies necessitate careful scrutiny. As FRC continues to shape public discourse and policy, its impact on the social and political landscape will remain significant.
