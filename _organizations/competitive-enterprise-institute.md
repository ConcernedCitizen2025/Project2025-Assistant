# Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)

## Overview
The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a libertarian think tank founded in 1984 by Fred L. Smith Jr., based in Washington, D.C. The institute promotes limited government, free enterprise, and individual liberty, with a particular focus on regulatory policy, energy, and environmental issues. CEI is known for its opposition to government regulations, particularly those related to climate change, which it argues hinder innovation and economic growth.

## Mission and Activities
CEI's mission is to advocate for economic liberty by challenging government regulations that it views as excessive or harmful to innovation. Key activities include:
- **Policy Advocacy:** CEI is active in opposing environmental regulations, promoting deregulation, and advocating for free-market solutions to policy issues.
- **Research and Publications:** The institute publishes reports such as the annual "Ten Thousand Commandments" that highlight the economic impact of federal regulations. CEI also engages in strategic litigation to advance its policy goals.
- **Litigation and Advocacy:** CEI uses legal strategies to challenge regulatory policies, especially in the environmental sector, aligning with its free-market ideology.

## Leadership and Influence
- **[Kent Lassman](/authors/kent-lassman.html):** President and CEO since 2016, Lassman has been instrumental in CEI’s focus on deregulation and economic freedom. He has contributed to Project 2025, underscoring CEI's influence within conservative policymaking circles.
- **[Fred L. Smith Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_L._Smith_(political_writer)):** Founder and President Emeritus, Smith has played a key role in shaping CEI’s libertarian approach, particularly in energy and environmental policy.
- **[Iain Murray](/contributors/iain-murray.html):** Senior Fellow, Murray focuses on challenging mainstream environmental policies, advocating instead for market-based solutions.

## Connections to Trump
CEI played a significant role in the Trump administration by supporting deregulation efforts and promoting policies that align with its free-market ideology. CEI’s participation in Project 2025, an initiative aimed at preparing for a potential second Trump term, further emphasizes its ongoing influence in shaping conservative policy agendas.

## Concerns
- **Climate Change Denial:** CEI has faced criticism for promoting skepticism about mainstream climate science, opposing regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Critics argue that CEI’s stance undermines global efforts to address climate change.

## Conclusion
The Competitive Enterprise Institute is a major force in advocating for libertarian principles and deregulation in the U.S. Its emphasis on economic freedom and limited government has significantly influenced public policy, particularly during the Trump administration. However, its controversial positions on issues like climate change continue to provoke debate over the balance between regulation and economic liberty.
