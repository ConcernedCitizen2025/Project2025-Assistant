# Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)

## Overview
The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a non-profit libertarian think tank founded in 1984 by Fred L. Smith Jr. in Washington, D.C. The institute focuses on promoting limited government, free enterprise, and individual liberty. CEI addresses a wide range of regulatory policy issues, including business, finance, labor, technology, and especially energy and the environment. CEI is known for its skepticism of mainstream climate science and its strong advocacy against government regulations that it argues stifle innovation and economic growth ([CEI](https://cei.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_Enterprise_Institute)).

## Mission and Activities
CEI's mission is to promote freedom and fairness by making the case for economic liberty as essential for entrepreneurship, innovation, and prosperity. Key activities include:
- **Policy Advocacy:** CEI advocates for deregulation and free-market solutions, arguing that government intervention often hampers innovation and economic growth. The organization is particularly active in opposing environmental regulations and promoting free-market environmentalism ([GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org)).
- **Research and Publications:** CEI publishes research and reports on various issues, including its annual "Ten Thousand Commandments" report, which highlights the cost of federal regulations on the American economy. This report is a cornerstone of CEI's efforts to draw attention to what it views as the hidden costs of government regulation ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).
- **Legal and Strategic Advocacy:** CEI engages in strategic litigation and regulatory reform efforts, often challenging environmental regulations and promoting policies that align with its free-market ideology ([GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Kent Lassman:** President and CEO of CEI since 2016, Lassman has been instrumental in steering the organization towards a strong focus on regulatory reform and economic freedom. His leadership reflects CEI's commitment to limiting government overreach and promoting free-market principles. Lassman has also contributed to Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative, underscoring CEI's influence within the broader conservative movement ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Lassman), [InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).
- **Fred L. Smith Jr.:** Founder and President Emeritus, Smith has been a vocal advocate for free markets and has shaped CEI's libertarian approach to public policy, particularly in the realms of energy and the environment ([GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org)).
- **Iain Murray:** Senior Fellow, Murrayâ€™s work focuses on regulatory reform and environmental policy, often challenging mainstream views on climate change and advocating for market-based solutions ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).

## Connections to Trump
CEI has had significant influence within the Trump administration, particularly in areas related to deregulation and environmental policy. The institute supported the Trump administration's efforts to roll back regulations and promoted policies in line with its free-market ideology. CEI's involvement in Project 2025 further underscores its ongoing influence in shaping conservative policy agendas ([Stop The Coup](https://www.stopthecoup2025.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_Enterprise_Institute)).

## Concerns
- **Climate Change Denial:** CEI has been known for promoting skepticism about mainstream climate science, arguing against the urgency of global warming and opposing regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This stance has made CEI a controversial figure in environmental policy debates, with critics arguing that its positions undermine efforts to address climate change ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_Enterprise_Institute), [GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org)).

## Conclusion
The Competitive Enterprise Institute plays a significant role in advocating for libertarian principles and deregulation in the U.S. Its strong emphasis on economic freedom and limited government has influenced public policy, particularly during the Trump administration. However, its controversial positions on issues like climate change highlight the ongoing debate over the balance between regulation and economic liberty ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_Enterprise_Institute), [GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org)).
