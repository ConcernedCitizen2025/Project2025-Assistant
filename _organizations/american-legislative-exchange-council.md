# American Legislative Exchange Council

## Overview
The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is a nonprofit organization that brings together conservative state legislators and private sector representatives to draft and share model legislation for use by state governments across the United States. Founded in 1973, ALEC promotes free-market principles, limited government, and federalism. The organization has significant influence, with its members representing a substantial portion of state legislators nationwide. ALEC has been instrumental in advancing conservative policies, particularly at the state level, through its extensive network and legislative initiatives ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council), [InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).

## Mission and Activities
ALEC’s mission is to advance the principles of free markets, limited government, and federalism through model policies that members can adapt and implement in their states. Key activities include:
- **Model Legislation:** ALEC develops and promotes model bills in areas such as education, health, energy, and criminal justice, which legislators can introduce in their state legislatures. These bills often reflect ALEC's conservative ideology and are designed to influence state policies nationwide ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council)).
- **Policy Centers and Task Forces:** ALEC hosts policy centers and task forces that focus on specific issues, providing forums for discussion and development of policy solutions. These task forces are critical in shaping the legislative agenda and ensuring that ALEC’s model policies are adopted across various states ([ALEC](https://www.alec.org)).
- **Annual Meetings:** ALEC organizes meetings and conferences where legislators and private sector representatives collaborate on policy initiatives. These events are key for networking and strategizing, further solidifying ALEC’s influence in state legislatures ([Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **Lisa B. Nelson:** CEO of ALEC since 2014, Nelson has played a crucial role in maintaining ALEC's influence in conservative policymaking circles. Under her leadership, ALEC has continued to be a significant force in state-level policy development, despite facing criticism and opposition ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council), [InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).
- **Chaz Cirame:** Senior Director of Membership and Development, Cirame is instrumental in expanding ALEC’s membership and ensuring active participation from both public and private sectors. His efforts help maintain ALEC's strong ties to the business community and its legislative influence ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council)).

## Connections to Trump
ALEC has significant connections to conservative policymaking, including links to the Trump administration. The organization is a member of the advisory board for Project 2025, an initiative organized by the Heritage Foundation aimed at shaping conservative policies for future Republican administrations. Former Vice President Mike Pence, a longtime supporter of ALEC, is one of the most prominent figures associated with both ALEC and the Trump administration ([InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council)).

## Concerns
- **Corporate Influence:** ALEC has been criticized for its close ties to corporations, particularly those in the fossil fuel industry, and for promoting legislation that benefits these entities. Critics argue that ALEC’s model legislation often prioritizes corporate interests over public welfare, particularly in areas like environmental regulation and labor rights ([SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council)).
- **Political Bias:** The organization’s strong conservative orientation has led to accusations of partisanship, especially in its promotion of voter ID laws and other policies that may disproportionately affect marginalized communities. ALEC's involvement in crafting legislation that limits voting access has been particularly controversial, with critics arguing that such laws are designed to suppress voter turnout among certain groups ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council), [InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org)).

## Conclusion
The American Legislative Exchange Council is a powerful force in conservative policymaking, known for its ability to influence legislation at the state level. While it champions free-market principles and limited government, its strong ties to corporate interests and conservative politics raise questions about the impartiality of its policy advocacy and the broader impacts of its legislative initiatives ([ALEC](https://www.alec.org), [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org), [Greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa)).
