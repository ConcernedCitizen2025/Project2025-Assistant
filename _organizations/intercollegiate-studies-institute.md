# Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI)

## Overview
The Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) is a nonprofit educational organization founded in 1953 by Frank Chodorov, with William F. Buckley Jr. serving as its first president. ISI is dedicated to promoting conservative thought on college campuses and aims to fill what it perceives as a void left by modern higher education's progressive orthodoxy. The organization focuses on educating students about principles such as limited government, individual liberty, personal responsibility, free-market economics, and traditional Judeo-Christian values ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercollegiate_Studies_Institute), [ISI](https://isi.org)).

## Mission and Activities
ISI's mission is to inspire college students to discover, embrace, and advance principles that support a free and prosperous society. Key activities include:
- **Educational Programs:** ISI offers various programs such as student societies, conferences, and fellowships that provide intellectual engagement and mentorship. The organization also runs the PPE Academy, which offers online courses in philosophy, politics, and economics ([ISI](https://isi.org), [PPE ISI](https://ppe.isi.org)).
- **Publications:** ISI publishes books, journals, and articles that promote conservative ideas and provide a platform for scholarly debate. The organization has partnered with Regnery Publishing to produce a range of titles focused on the humanities and Western culture ([Regnery Publishing](https://www.regnery.com)).
- **Events and Lectures:** ISI hosts lectures and debates on college campuses to engage students and faculty in discussions about conservative principles ([ISI](https://isi.org)).

## Leadership and Influence
- **John A. Burtka IV:** President and CEO of ISI. Burtka has a background in theology and has worked to expand ISI's outreach and influence within academic and conservative circles ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercollegiate_Studies_Institute)).
- **Hannah Rowan:** Managing Editor of ISI's journal *Modern Age*. Rowan's background in journalism and English from Hillsdale College highlights her role in shaping the organization's communication and editorial strategies ([ISI](https://isi.org)).
- **Thomas E. Lynch:** Chairman of the Board. Lynch's leadership contributes to ISI's strategic direction and financial stability ([ISI](https://isi.org)).

## Connections to Trump
ISI is listed as a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, an initiative organized by the Heritage Foundation to develop conservative policy proposals for future Republican administrations. This connection highlights ISI's ongoing influence within the broader conservative movement and its alignment with efforts to shape national policy ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercollegiate_Studies_Institute)).

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** ISI is noted for its strong conservative bias, often favoring right-leaning perspectives in its publications and activities. While it is rated as mostly factual, the organization's content is primarily opinion-based and aimed at promoting conservative values, which may limit the diversity of viewpoints presented ([Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com)).
- **Historical Controversies:** In the past, ISI has faced criticism for featuring neo-Confederate views in its publications, a historical aspect that underscores the need for critical examination of its content and influences ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercollegiate_Studies_Institute)).

## Conclusion
The Intercollegiate Studies Institute plays a significant role in promoting conservative thought and education on college campuses. Its programs and publications aim to fill perceived gaps in modern higher education by advocating for traditional American principles. However, its strong ideological stance and historical controversies warrant careful scrutiny to ensure balanced and comprehensive educational offerings ([ISI](https://isi.org), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercollegiate_Studies_Institute)).
