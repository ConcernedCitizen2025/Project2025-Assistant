# Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI)

## Overview
The Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) is a nonprofit educational organization founded in 1953 by Frank Chodorov, with William F. Buckley Jr. as its first president. ISI is dedicated to promoting conservative thought on college campuses and aims to address what it perceives as the progressive dominance in higher education. The organization focuses on educating students about principles such as limited government, individual liberty, personal responsibility, free-market economics, and traditional Judeo-Christian values.

## Mission and Activities
ISI's mission is to inspire college students to discover, embrace, and advance principles that support a free and prosperous society. Key activities include:
- **Educational Programs:** ISI offers various programs such as student societies, conferences, and fellowships that provide intellectual engagement and mentorship. The organization also runs the PPE Academy, offering online courses in philosophy, politics, and economics.
- **Publications:** ISI publishes books, journals, and articles that promote conservative ideas and provide a platform for scholarly debate. The organization has partnered with Regnery Publishing to produce a range of titles focused on the humanities and Western culture.
- **Events and Lectures:** ISI hosts lectures and debates on college campuses to engage students and faculty in discussions about conservative principles.

## Leadership and Influence
- **John A. Burtka IV:** President and CEO of ISI. Burtka has a background in theology and has expanded ISI's outreach within academic and conservative circles.
- **Hannah Rowan:** Managing Editor of ISI's journal *Modern Age*. Rowan plays a significant role in shaping ISI’s editorial strategy, with a focus on promoting conservative scholarship.
- **Thomas E. Lynch:** Chairman of the Board. Lynch’s leadership supports ISI’s strategic direction and financial stability.

## Connections to Trump
ISI is listed as a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, an initiative organized by the Heritage Foundation to develop conservative policy proposals for future Republican administrations. This connection underscores ISI's influence within the broader conservative movement and its alignment with efforts to shape national policy during potential future Republican-led administrations.

## Concerns
- **Political Bias:** ISI has been noted for its strong conservative bias, with much of its content favoring right-leaning perspectives. While ISI is rated as mostly factual, the organization’s content is primarily opinion-based, often designed to support conservative viewpoints and critique progressive ideologies.
- **Historical Controversies:** In the past, ISI has faced criticism for featuring neo-Confederate views in its publications, an aspect of its history that raises concerns about the diversity of perspectives it presents.

## Conclusion
The Intercollegiate Studies Institute plays a significant role in promoting conservative thought and education on college campuses. Its programs and publications aim to provide a counterbalance to progressive ideologies in higher education by advocating for traditional American principles. However, its strong ideological stance and historical controversies warrant careful scrutiny to ensure balanced and comprehensive educational offerings.
