# "Federal Election Commission" *Between the Lines*

### In-Depth Analysis:

1. **Presidential Nomination Authority:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The proposal emphasizes the importance of the President nominating FEC commissioners who align with the administration's views on minimizing regulation and upholding First Amendment rights in campaign finance. It also suggests that the President should attempt to influence the selection of opposition party nominees to ensure they are not overly aggressive in enforcing campaign finance laws.
   - **Concerning Implications:** This approach could lead to the politicization of the FEC, potentially compromising its ability to function as a neutral enforcer of campaign finance laws. If commissioners are selected based on their willingness to underenforce regulations, it could result in increased instances of campaign finance violations going unchecked, undermining the integrity of federal elections.
   - **Potential Consequences:** The nomination of commissioners based on their political alignment rather than their qualifications and commitment to impartial enforcement could weaken the FEC's effectiveness. This may lead to a lack of accountability in campaign finance, potentially enabling corruption and reducing public trust in the electoral process.

2. **Department of Justice's Role in Enforcing Campaign Finance Laws:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The document recommends that the President direct the Department of Justice (DOJ) to prosecute only clear violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) and to avoid cases where the FEC is divided or where the law is ambiguous. The DOJ should defer to the FEC's interpretations in such cases.
   - **Concerning Implications:** This policy could reduce the DOJ's ability to enforce campaign finance laws, particularly in cases where the FEC is deadlocked or where there is ambiguity in the law. This may result in fewer prosecutions for campaign finance violations, potentially allowing illegal activities to go unpunished.
   - **Potential Consequences:** By limiting the DOJ's prosecutorial discretion, this proposal could create a loophole for campaign finance violators, especially in contentious or complex cases. This could erode the enforcement of campaign finance laws and diminish the deterrent effect of potential prosecutions, leading to an increase in illegal campaign activities.

3. **Opposing Changes to FEC Structure:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The proposal strongly opposes reducing the number of FEC commissioners from six to five, as suggested in previous legislative efforts. The argument is that maintaining an even number of commissioners ensures bipartisan agreement before any enforcement action is taken.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While the current structure is intended to prevent partisan bias, it often leads to deadlocks that hinder the FEC's ability to enforce campaign finance laws effectively. This deadlock can result in a lack of enforcement, allowing violations to persist without consequence.
   - **Potential Consequences:** The continued deadlock within the FEC could prevent the agency from fulfilling its mandate to regulate campaign finance effectively. This could lead to an increase in unchecked campaign finance violations, weakening the overall integrity of the electoral system.

4. **Legislative Recommendations to Prevent Overenforcement:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The proposal includes recommendations for legislative changes that would limit the FEC's ability to "overenforce" campaign finance laws, such as raising contribution limits and reducing restrictions on coordination between political parties and candidates.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While these changes are framed as protecting First Amendment rights, they could also weaken campaign finance regulations designed to prevent corruption and ensure fair elections. Reducing restrictions on coordination and increasing contribution limits could lead to greater influence by wealthy donors and special interest groups in federal elections.
   - **Potential Consequences:** Easing campaign finance regulations could lead to an increase in the influence of money in politics, potentially undermining the principle of equal representation in the democratic process. This could result in elections that are increasingly dominated by wealthy individuals and organizations, eroding public confidence in the fairness of the electoral system.

### Conclusion:
The proposals related to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in this section of Project 2025 suggest a shift toward reducing regulatory oversight and enforcement in campaign finance. While these changes are presented as necessary to protect First Amendment rights and prevent overregulation, they raise significant concerns about the potential for increased corruption, reduced accountability, and the erosion of public trust in the electoral process. The focus on minimizing enforcement and maintaining a bipartisan deadlock within the FEC could lead to a weakening of campaign finance laws, allowing violations to go unchecked and potentially undermining the integrity of federal elections. These proposals warrant careful consideration to ensure that they do not compromise the democratic principles that underpin the U.S. electoral system.

## Potential Concerns: Federal Election Commission

### Risk of Deregulation Leading to Increased Influence of Wealthy Donors
The proposal to appoint commissioners who prioritize First Amendment protections and the emphasis on raising contribution limits and relaxing coordination rules between party committees and candidates could lead to a less regulated campaign finance environment. While this approach aims to protect free speech, it also risks increasing the influence of wealthy individuals and special interest groups. Higher contribution limits may allow affluent donors to exert more control over the political process, potentially overshadowing the voices of ordinary citizens and skewing political power toward those with greater financial resources.

### Potential for Partisan Control and Loss of Credibility
The FEC's structure is designed to be bipartisan, preventing any single party from dominating the agency. However, there is a concern that efforts to appoint commissioners with specific ideological leanings could tilt the balance of the agency, undermining its impartiality. If the FEC is perceived as being biased or partisan, it could lose credibility and public trust. This perception could weaken the agency's effectiveness in regulating campaign finance and ensuring fair elections, as decisions may be viewed through a partisan lens rather than as objective enforcement of the law.

### Overemphasis on Free Speech at the Expense of Preventing Corruption
While protecting free speech is crucial, an overemphasis on this principle could lead to insufficient regulation of campaign finance. The FEC's role in preventing corruption and ensuring transparency in political funding is critical for maintaining the integrity of the electoral process. There is a concern that focusing too heavily on First Amendment protections might result in inadequate oversight and enforcement, allowing for potentially corrupt practices and diminishing the public's ability to hold candidates and parties accountable for their financial backers.

### Challenges in Aligning FEC and DOJ Enforcement Actions
The suggestion that the DOJ should align its enforcement actions with the FEC's interpretations raises concerns about maintaining the independence of these two bodies. While consistency in enforcement is important, there is a risk that close alignment could blur the lines between civil and criminal enforcement. This could potentially lead to conflicts of interest or compromise the impartiality of prosecutions. The independence of the DOJ is vital for upholding the rule of law, and any efforts to overly synchronize its actions with the FEC could undermine this independence.

### Insufficient Attention to Transparency and Accountability
The proposed reforms focus heavily on protecting political speech and reducing regulatory burdens but may not adequately address the need for transparency and accountability in campaign finance. Ensuring that the sources of political funding are disclosed and that spending is monitored is essential for preventing corruption and ensuring that voters can make informed decisions. There is a concern that the reforms may prioritize deregulation over these crucial aspects, potentially leading to a less transparent and accountable political system.

### Conclusion
In summary, while the proposed changes to the FEC aim to enhance free speech protections and streamline campaign finance regulation, they raise significant concerns about increased influence of money in politics, potential partisan bias, and the adequacy of oversight mechanisms. Balancing the protection of free expression with the need for robust regulation to prevent corruption and maintain transparency is essential for safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process.

## Breaking Down the Concerns: Federal Election Commission

- **Influence of Wealthy Donors:**
  Raising the limits on campaign contributions could give rich people and groups more control over elections. This might drown out the voices of everyday citizens, making politics more about who has the most money.

- **Risk of Partisan Bias:**
  There's a concern that appointing commissioners with strong political beliefs could make the FEC biased. If the agency seems to favor one party, it could lose trust and be less effective in keeping elections fair.

- **Balancing Free Speech and Corruption Prevention:**
  While protecting free speech is important, there's a worry that focusing too much on it could weaken rules meant to stop corruption. Without strong regulations, there could be more shady practices in campaign finance.

- **Coordination Between FEC and DOJ:**
  Aligning the actions of the FEC and the Department of Justice too closely could blur their separate roles. It's important that the DOJ stays independent to ensure fair legal processes, free from undue influence.

- **Transparency and Accountability:**
  The focus on reducing regulations might not do enough to ensure transparency in political funding. It's crucial to know where campaign money comes from and how it's spent, so voters can make informed choices.

## <span id="redflags">Red Flags in the Reforms: Analyzing Troubling Quotes</span>

- ***Quote:** "Nomination Authority. The President’s most significant power is the appointment of the six commissioners who govern the FEC, subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 826).*  

    - **Summarize Quote:** The President appoints the commissioners who run the FEC, pending Senate approval.

    - **Explanation:** This emphasizes the substantial influence the President holds over the FEC, an agency responsible for enforcing federal election laws. This power could be exploited to appoint commissioners with partisan biases, leading to decisions favoring the President's party. Such potential partisanship threatens the FEC's role as an impartial overseer, raising concerns about the fairness and integrity of electoral processes.

- ***Quote:** "Raise contribution limits and index reporting requirements to inflation. Contribution limits should generally be much higher, as they hamstring candidates and parties while serving no practical anticorruption purpose" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 830).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** Increase campaign contribution limits, as current limits don't effectively prevent corruption.  

    - **Explanation:** Increasing contribution limits can lead to more significant amounts of money flowing into campaigns, potentially increasing the influence of wealthy individuals and entities. This change could exacerbate issues of inequality in political influence, undermining the democratic principle of equal representation and increasing the risk of corruption.

- ***Quote:** "As former FEC Chairman Bradley Smith says, the 'greater problem at the FEC has been overenforcement,' not underenforcement as some critics falsely allege" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 831).*  

    - **Summarize Quote:** The FEC has been too strict in its enforcement, not too lenient.  

    - **Explanation:** This statement implies a need to reduce the FEC's regulatory and enforcement activities. Such a reduction could lead to a lax enforcement environment, allowing more violations of campaign finance laws to go unchecked. This could undermine efforts to maintain fair and transparent elections and erode public trust in the electoral process.

- ***Quote:** "The President assuming office in 2025 must ensure, if the three Republican commissioners do not wish to remain on the FEC past their terms, that nominees for these positions share the views of those commissioners" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 828).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The President should appoint new FEC commissioners who share the views of outgoing Republican commissioners.  

    - **Explanation:** This guidance explicitly encourages the appointment of commissioners with specific political leanings, which could compromise the FEC's impartiality. By stacking the commission with ideologically aligned individuals, the President could influence the FEC's decisions to favor their party, potentially undermining the integrity of the electoral process and public confidence in election fairness.

- ***Quote:** "While the FEC has exclusive civil enforcement authority over FECA, the U.S. Justice Department has criminal enforcement authority, which is defined as a knowing and willful violation of the law. Because the FEC is an independent agency and not a division or office directly within the executive branch, the authority of the President over the actions of the FEC is extremely limited" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 826).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The FEC handles civil enforcement of election laws, while the DOJ handles criminal enforcement, and the President has limited control over the FEC.

    - **Explanation:** This quote underscores the independent nature of the FEC, highlighting the separation of civil and criminal enforcement of election laws. The emphasis on the President's limited control over the FEC is crucial, as it preserves the agency's impartiality and protects it from political influence. However, concerns arise if there are efforts to undermine this independence, as it could lead to partisan enforcement of election laws, potentially affecting the fairness and integrity of elections.

- ***Quote:** "The President should direct the DOJ and the attorney general not to prosecute individuals under an interpretation of the law with which the FEC... does not agree" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 828).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The DOJ should avoid prosecuting election law violations if the FEC does not agree with the legal interpretation.

    - **Explanation:** This quote suggests that the DOJ should defer to the FEC's interpretation of election laws when deciding whether to prosecute individuals. While consistency between agencies is important, this approach could limit the DOJ's ability to independently pursue criminal cases, potentially allowing violations to go unpunished if the FEC is divided or politically biased. It raises concerns about the possibility of inconsistent enforcement of election laws, which could undermine public trust in the integrity of elections and the impartiality of the justice system.

- ***Quote:** "The President should seriously consider recommending that Congress amend FECA to remove the agency’s independent litigating authority and rely on the Department of Justice to handle all litigation involving the FEC" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 829).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The suggestion is to eliminate the FEC's independent litigating authority and have the DOJ handle all litigation.

    - **Explanation:** This proposal to remove the FEC's independent litigating authority and shift it to the DOJ could undermine the FEC's independence and impartiality. The DOJ, being part of the executive branch, is subject to political influence, which could affect how election law cases are prosecuted. Centralizing litigation authority could lead to biased enforcement, with decisions potentially swayed by the administration's political agenda. This change might reduce the checks and balances necessary for fair and impartial enforcement of election laws.

- ***Quote:** "Efforts to impose a 'nonpartisan' or so-called 'independent' chair are impractical; the chair will inevitably be aligned with his or her appointing party, at least as a matter of perception" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 830).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The idea of a nonpartisan or independent FEC chair is seen as unrealistic, as they will likely align with their appointing party.

    - **Explanation:** This statement dismisses the feasibility of appointing a genuinely nonpartisan or independent FEC chair, suggesting that such a person will inevitably be perceived as aligned with their appointing party. This viewpoint is concerning as it implies acceptance of partisanship within the FEC, potentially eroding public confidence in the agency's neutrality. If the FEC is perceived as partisan, it may affect its ability to fairly regulate and enforce campaign finance laws, which are crucial for ensuring transparent and fair elections.

### Conclusion
The "Federal Election Commission" subsection of Project 2025 highlights proposals that could significantly alter the structure and function of the FEC, raising concerns about potential partisanship and reduced independence. The emphasis on appointing ideologically aligned commissioners, directing the DOJ to align with FEC interpretations, and potentially removing the FEC's independent litigating authority all suggest a shift towards greater executive control over the agency. These changes could undermine the FEC's role as an impartial enforcer of election laws, leading to biased enforcement and a lack of accountability.

The potential implications of the immunity ruling could further exacerbate these issues by protecting actions taken by the FEC and DOJ from legal challenges, reducing transparency and accountability. This could lead to a scenario where election laws are enforced selectively, possibly targeting political opponents or shielding allies, which would undermine the fairness and integrity of the electoral process. Given the sensitive nature of the FEC's work in regulating political speech and campaign finance, it is crucial to maintain its independence and impartiality to uphold democratic principles and public trust in elections.

This analysis underscores the need for vigilance and careful consideration of the implications of these proposed changes, as they could fundamentally alter the balance of power and fairness in the American political system.

## <span id="nutshell">"Federal Election Commission" in a Nutshell</span>

The analysis of the "Federal Election Commission" (FEC) section in Project 2025 reveals several proposals that could dramatically reshape the FEC's role and operations, raising significant concerns about the potential impact on the integrity of U.S. elections.

### Key Issues and Concerns:

1. **Presidential Influence on FEC Appointments:**
   - The proposal emphasizes the President's role in appointing FEC commissioners who align with minimizing regulation and protecting First Amendment rights in campaign finance. This could lead to the appointment of commissioners with strong political biases, potentially compromising the FEC's ability to function as an impartial regulator of campaign finance laws. If the FEC becomes politically polarized, it could result in biased enforcement of campaign finance regulations, undermining the fairness and transparency of elections.

2. **DOJ's Role in Campaign Finance Enforcement:**
   - The proposal suggests that the Department of Justice (DOJ) should only prosecute clear violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) and defer to the FEC's interpretations in cases of ambiguity. This could limit the DOJ's ability to enforce campaign finance laws effectively, particularly in complex or contentious cases where the FEC is deadlocked. As a result, illegal activities might go unpunished, creating loopholes that could be exploited, further weakening the enforcement of campaign finance regulations.

3. **Opposition to Reducing the Number of FEC Commissioners:**
   - The proposal opposes efforts to reduce the number of FEC commissioners from six to five, arguing that the current even number ensures bipartisan agreement before any enforcement action is taken. While this structure is intended to prevent partisan bias, it often leads to deadlocks, where no action is taken due to a lack of majority agreement. This can hinder the FEC's ability to enforce campaign finance laws effectively, allowing violations to persist and weakening public confidence in the electoral process.

4. **Concerns About Overenforcement:**
   - The document argues that the FEC has historically overenforced campaign finance laws, placing unnecessary burdens on small campaigns and chilling political speech. The proposal suggests raising contribution limits and reducing restrictions on coordination between political parties and candidates. While these changes are framed as protecting free speech, they could also weaken safeguards against corruption, allowing wealthy donors and special interest groups to exert greater influence over elections.

### Potential Consequences:

- **Increased Political Influence Over the FEC:**
  If the President appoints commissioners who share specific political views, the FEC could become more partisan, undermining its role as an impartial enforcer of campaign finance laws. This could lead to biased decisions that favor certain political parties or candidates, eroding public trust in the electoral system.

- **Weakened Enforcement of Campaign Finance Laws:**
  By limiting the DOJ's prosecutorial discretion and relying on the FEC's interpretations, there is a risk that fewer violations will be prosecuted, particularly in complex cases. This could embolden those who seek to exploit loopholes in campaign finance laws, increasing the likelihood of corruption and reducing accountability.

- **Continued Deadlocks and Inaction:**
  The opposition to reducing the number of FEC commissioners may preserve the current deadlock-prone structure, where disagreements between commissioners prevent effective enforcement. This could lead to a situation where campaign finance violations go unaddressed, further undermining the integrity of federal elections.

- **Greater Influence of Money in Politics:**
  Easing regulations, such as raising contribution limits and reducing restrictions on coordination, could lead to an influx of money in politics. This could disproportionately benefit wealthy donors and special interest groups, potentially skewing political power in their favor and diminishing the voices of ordinary citizens.

### Conclusion:
The "Federal Election Commission" section of Project 2025 outlines a vision that could significantly alter the agency's structure and function. While these proposals are framed as necessary to protect free speech and reduce overregulation, they raise serious concerns about the potential for increased political influence, weakened enforcement of campaign finance laws, and greater susceptibility to corruption. The proposed changes could compromise the FEC's ability to ensure fair and transparent elections, making it critical to carefully consider the long-term implications of these reforms on the health of American democracy.
