# "The Case for Free Trade" *Between the Lines*

### In-Depth Analysis:

1. **Eliminating Tariffs Under Sections 232, 201, and 301:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The proposal advocates for repealing tariffs implemented under Sections 232, 201, and 301, with a focus on removing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and Chinese goods. The recommendation is to eliminate these tariffs to lower consumer prices and support American manufacturing and trade relations.
   - **Concerning Implications:** Removing these tariffs could potentially expose American industries to unfair competition, particularly from countries like China, which have been known to engage in practices such as dumping and intellectual property theft. Additionally, the removal of tariffs might undermine U.S. leverage in trade negotiations with countries that are not adhering to fair trade practices.
   - **Potential Consequences:** While the removal of these tariffs may reduce consumer prices in the short term, it could lead to long-term harm to American manufacturing sectors that rely on these protections to compete against subsidized foreign industries. This could result in job losses and a weakened industrial base in the U.S. Furthermore, by eliminating tariffs unilaterally, the U.S. might lose negotiating power in seeking concessions from trade partners, leading to imbalances in trade agreements.

2. **Repealing the Jones Act:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The proposal suggests repealing the Jones Act, which mandates that goods transported between U.S. ports be carried on ships that are U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, and U.S.-crewed. The argument is that this law has led to higher costs for American consumers and weakened the U.S. maritime industry.
   - **Concerning Implications:** Repealing the Jones Act could have significant implications for national security by making the U.S. more dependent on foreign-built and foreign-crewed vessels, which could be a strategic vulnerability during conflicts or trade disputes. The U.S. maritime industry might also suffer further decline, leading to a loss of shipbuilding capacity and maritime jobs.
   - **Potential Consequences:** While the repeal could lower shipping costs, it could also result in increased reliance on foreign shipping, potentially compromising national security and leading to economic dependencies that could be exploited by adversaries. The decline in the U.S. shipbuilding industry could also have ripple effects on related industries and military preparedness.

3. **Closing the Export-Import Bank:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The recommendation is to close the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), arguing that it primarily benefits a small number of large corporations, particularly Boeing, and has been co-opted to serve progressive policy goals that may not align with conservative principles.
   - **Concerning Implications:** Closing EXIM could disadvantage American exporters, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that rely on EXIM financing to compete internationally. It might also weaken the U.S.'s ability to support strategic industries in the face of aggressive foreign competition, particularly from state-backed enterprises in China and other countries.
   - **Potential Consequences:** The elimination of EXIM could lead to a decline in U.S. exports, particularly in industries where financing is critical for securing international contracts. This could weaken the U.S. economy and reduce American influence in global markets. Additionally, without EXIM, U.S. companies might be at a disadvantage compared to foreign competitors that receive significant support from their governments.

4. **Restoring or Replacing the WTO Dispute Resolution Process:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The proposal suggests either restoring the World Trade Organizationâ€™s (WTO) dispute resolution process or replacing it with a new system that is limited to liberal democracies. This would ensure that the U.S. has a reliable mechanism for resolving trade disputes and enforcing trade rules.
   - **Concerning Implications:** Restricting a new trade dispute system to liberal democracies could lead to fragmentation of the global trading system, potentially isolating the U.S. from important markets and reducing its influence in shaping global trade norms. It could also trigger retaliatory measures from excluded countries, leading to trade wars and economic instability.
   - **Potential Consequences:** While a new system might strengthen trade relations among like-minded countries, it could also undermine the multilateral trading system, leading to increased protectionism and a breakdown in global trade cooperation. The exclusion of major economies like China and India could lead to significant disruptions in global supply chains and increased geopolitical tensions.

### Constitutional Conflict:

- **Constitutional Conflict:** The proposal to repeal Sections 232, 201, and 301 tariffs raises a potential constitutional conflict. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations (Article I, Section 8). The delegation of this power to the President through these sections of trade law has long been controversial. Repealing these provisions without clear Congressional oversight could be seen as undermining the Constitution's separation of powers and Congress's authority over trade policy.
- **Citation:** U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 ("To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes").

This analysis covers the major concerning policies in the subsection and highlights the potential implications and consequences these proposals could have on the U.S. economy, national security, and constitutional governance.

## Potential Concerns: Trade - The Case for Free Trade

### Economic Dislocation and Job Losses
The advocacy for free trade emphasizes the benefits of comparative advantage and global competition. However, it overlooks the significant economic dislocation that can occur, particularly in industries unable to compete with cheaper imports. The potential for job losses, particularly in manufacturing and other traditionally strong domestic sectors, raises concerns about unemployment and the need for retraining programs, which the document does not adequately address.

### Neglect of Environmental and Labor Standards
The subsection's resistance to incorporating environmental and labor standards into trade agreements raises concerns about the potential for a "race to the bottom." Without these standards, countries might lower protections to attract business, leading to environmental degradation and exploitation of workers. This approach can undermine sustainable development goals and result in long-term social and environmental consequences.

### Geopolitical Risks and Economic Imperialism
While promoting free trade as a means of fostering international stability, the subsection's emphasis on leveraging trade agreements for geopolitical influence could lead to accusations of economic imperialism. This risk is particularly acute if powerful countries use trade agreements to impose their economic and political preferences on weaker nations, potentially causing international tensions and resentment.

### Undermining National Sovereignty and Economic Nationalism
The strong stance against protectionism may ignore the growing sentiment of economic nationalism and concerns about national sovereignty. By dismissing protectionist policies, there is a risk of political backlash from domestic constituencies who feel their jobs and industries are being sacrificed for the sake of global trade. This could lead to increased political instability and opposition to free trade policies.

### Insufficient Attention to Worker and Community Support
The document does not adequately address the need for support systems for workers and communities affected by trade liberalization. Without measures such as retraining programs, unemployment benefits, and economic diversification initiatives, the negative impacts of free trade on certain sectors could exacerbate social inequalities and lead to long-term economic hardship for vulnerable populations.

### Potential Erosion of Consumer Protections
The push for free trade often involves reducing tariffs and regulatory barriers, which can sometimes lead to the erosion of consumer protections. For example, products entering the market may not adhere to the same safety and quality standards as those domestically produced, posing risks to consumer health and safety.

### Conclusion
These concerns highlight the need for a balanced approach to free trade that considers not only the economic benefits but also the broader social, environmental, and geopolitical implications. Without careful management, the pursuit of free trade could exacerbate existing inequalities and create new challenges for domestic and international stability.

## Breaking Down the Concerns: Trade - The Case for Free Trade

- **Job Losses:** Free trade might lead to some industries losing out to cheaper foreign competition, causing job losses in sectors that can't compete.

- **Ignoring Environmental and Worker Protections:** Without rules on environmental and labor standards, some countries might lower protections to attract business, which could harm the environment and workers.

- **Geopolitical Risks:** Using trade deals to gain political influence could upset other countries, potentially causing international tensions.

- **Loss of National Control:** Pushing for free trade without considering local industries might upset people who feel their country's economy is being put at risk.

- **Lack of Support for Affected Workers:** There's not enough focus on helping workers and communities who might lose jobs due to free trade.

- **Consumer Safety Concerns:** Reducing trade barriers might lead to lower safety standards for products, posing risks to consumers.

## <span id="redflags">Red Flags in the Reforms: Analyzing Troubling Quotes</span>

- ***Quote:** "Trade policy is about more than goods and services: It is a statement of American identity. Our trade policy choices reveal Americaâ€™s values and where we put our trust. Do we place our trust in Washington elites to revive a declining country or do we trust in Americaâ€™s tradition of entrepreneurs and everyday people blazing new trails" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 764)?*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote suggests that trade policy reflects American values and questions whether to trust government elites or the entrepreneurial spirit of ordinary people.

    - **Explanation:** This statement sets up a dichotomy between government intervention and individual entrepreneurship. By framing the issue as a choice between "Washington elites" and "entrepreneurs and everyday people," it suggests a distrust of government involvement in trade policy. This perspective can undermine the role of government in regulating trade to ensure fair practices and protect national interests. It may also imply a push towards deregulation, which could lead to insufficient oversight and the potential for exploitation by larger corporations at the expense of smaller businesses and consumers.

- ***Quote:** "Recent progressive attempts to use trade policy to advance whole-of-government initiatives on climate equity and other issues will fail for the same reason that a hammer cannot turn a screw: It is the wrong tool for the job" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 765).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote criticizes using trade policy to address issues like climate change and equity, arguing that it is an ineffective approach.

    - **Explanation:** This critique dismisses the integration of social and environmental goals within trade agreements, suggesting that trade policy should not be used to address broader issues such as climate change and equity. By downplaying these concerns, the quote overlooks the potential for trade policy to promote sustainable development and social justice. This perspective could lead to the exclusion of important standards and protections in trade agreements, potentially resulting in negative social and environmental impacts. It also reflects a narrow view of trade policy, ignoring the interconnectedness of economic, social, and environmental issues.

- ***Quote:** "Trade agreements since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have been increasingly burdened by trade-unrelated provisions involving labor, environmental, intellectual property, and other regulations. A conservative trade policy should limit trade-unrelated provisions in trade agreements" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 765).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote argues that trade agreements have been bogged down by non-trade issues and suggests that these should be minimized.

    - **Explanation:** The statement criticizes the inclusion of provisions related to labor, environment, and other regulations in trade agreements, arguing that they complicate negotiations. While it is true that such provisions can add complexity, they also serve important functions in protecting workers' rights, environmental standards, and intellectual property. Excluding these issues from trade agreements could weaken protections and lead to a race to the bottom in standards, where countries might lower regulations to attract trade and investment. This approach could undermine efforts to promote fair and sustainable trade practices globally.

- ***Quote:** "Foreign policy considerations are not as separate from trade as are labor or environmental standards. China deserves special consideration as does the World Trade Organization (WTO) along with its possible successors or alternatives" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 765).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote suggests that foreign policy is closely tied to trade, particularly concerning China and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

    - **Explanation:** This statement acknowledges the importance of foreign policy in trade decisions, particularly in relation to China and the WTO. The emphasis on China indicates a focus on addressing challenges posed by its trade practices and geopolitical influence. However, the reference to potential alternatives to the WTO suggests a willingness to bypass established international trade norms and institutions. This approach could destabilize the global trading system and lead to increased tensions and trade disputes. It also hints at a unilateral or protectionist stance that may not align with international cooperation and rules-based trade.

- ***Quote:** "A conservative trade policy must also take seriously the reality that in a democracy the other side holds power about half of the time but progressives run most agencies almost all of the time" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 765).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote argues that progressive control of government agencies is a concern for conservative trade policy.

    - **Explanation:** This statement reflects a distrust of progressive influence within government agencies, suggesting that it poses a challenge to implementing conservative trade policies. By framing agency control as a partisan issue, the quote undermines the neutrality and expertise of civil servants. It implies that agency actions are driven by political ideology rather than objective analysis and public interest. This perspective could lead to efforts to reduce the autonomy of regulatory agencies or replace personnel based on political alignment rather than qualifications, potentially compromising the quality and impartiality of governance.

- ***Quote:** "Neither free trade nor protectionism will create jobs. Trade affects the types of jobs people have, but it has no long-run effect on the number of jobs. Labor force size is tied to population size more than anything else. The American people are smart and sophisticated enough to hear these truths" (Project 2025, p 765).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote asserts that trade policy does not affect the total number of jobs, only the types of jobs available, and emphasizes the role of population size.

    - **Explanation:** This statement dismisses the impact of trade policy on job creation, attributing job numbers primarily to population size. While technically accurate, this perspective ignores the real impact trade policies can have on the quality and nature of employment. For example, shifts in trade policy can lead to the loss of manufacturing jobs and the creation of service jobs, which may not offer comparable wages or job security. This can exacerbate income inequality and economic insecurity. The quote also implies a level of economic determinism, suggesting that policy interventions are limited in their ability to influence employment outcomes, which can be disempowering for policymakers and the public seeking to address economic disparities.

- ***Quote:** "Conservatives should be similarly skeptical of recent attempts on the Right to use progressive trade policy to punish political opponents, remake manufacturing, or accomplish other objectives for which it is not suited" (Project 2025, p 765).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote advises conservatives to be wary of using trade policy for political purposes or to achieve goals unrelated to trade.

    - **Explanation:** This statement warns against the use of trade policy as a tool for political maneuvering or for advancing unrelated policy goals, such as remaking manufacturing or addressing social issues. The concern here is that using trade policy for non-trade purposes can lead to inefficiencies and unintended consequences. However, this perspective also potentially undermines legitimate uses of trade policy to promote broader societal goals, such as environmental protection, labor rights, and human rights. By framing these goals as "progressive," the quote suggests they are partisan and possibly inappropriate for trade policy, which may discourage comprehensive approaches to international trade that consider its wide-ranging impacts.

- ***Quote:** "Protectionism and similar progressive policies tend to weaken American security but trade creates peace. The more countries trade the less likely they are to fight one another and the more robust their supply networks will be" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 778).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote argues that protectionist policies weaken security, while free trade promotes peace by reducing the likelihood of conflict.

    - **Explanation:** This statement posits that free trade fosters peace by creating interdependencies among countries, making conflict less likely. While the concept of trade as a peace-promoting tool is valid, the blanket dismissal of protectionist policies overlooks situations where such measures may be necessary to protect national industries and security. The assertion that protectionism weakens security is an oversimplification, as trade restrictions can also serve as tools for addressing unfair practices and safeguarding strategic interests. The emphasis on free trade without considering its potential drawbacks can lead to policies that prioritize economic gains over other important considerations, such as national security and social stability.

- ***Quote:** "The U.S. should enact mutual recognition agreements for a wide variety of goods with the United Kingdom, European Union, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and other governments with high standards comparable to our own" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 776).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote advocates for mutual recognition agreements with countries that have high standards similar to those of the U.S.

    - **Explanation:** Mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) facilitate trade by allowing products approved in one country to be sold in another without additional testing or certification. While MRAs can reduce trade barriers and regulatory costs, they also require confidence in the other party's regulatory standards. The emphasis on high standards suggests a selective approach to trade partners, potentially excluding countries with different regulatory frameworks. This could limit market access for U.S. goods and services and reduce the diversity of available products. Additionally, MRAs may lead to regulatory convergence, which can be beneficial but may also pose challenges in maintaining domestic regulatory autonomy.

### Conclusion

The subsection "The Case for Free Trade" outlines a vision for trade policy that emphasizes minimal government intervention, prioritization of traditional conservative values, and a skepticism of progressive influences. The document critiques the inclusion of labor, environmental, and social issues in trade agreements, arguing that these complicate trade negotiations and are outside the proper scope of trade policy. There is also a clear stance against protectionism and a strong endorsement of free trade as a means to promote peace and economic stability.

#### Red Flags and Potential Impact

- **Exclusion of Social and Environmental Standards:** By advocating for the exclusion of labor, environmental, and other non-trade issues from trade agreements, the document risks undermining protections for workers, the environment, and intellectual property. This could lead to a "race to the bottom" in standards as countries compete to attract business by lowering regulations.

- **Distrust of Government Agencies:** The distrust expressed towards government agencies, particularly those perceived as influenced by progressive policies, suggests a push for deregulation and reduced oversight. This could result in less effective governance and oversight, potentially compromising consumer protections and public welfare.

- **Simplification of Trade Policy Impacts:** The statement that trade policy does not affect the total number of jobs oversimplifies the impact of trade on the economy. While it may not change the overall number of jobs, trade policy significantly affects the types and quality of jobs, with implications for wage levels, job security, and economic inequality.

- **Potential for Increased Trade Tensions:** The emphasis on China's perceived threat and the suggestion of seeking alternatives to the WTO reflect a confrontational approach to international trade. This could lead to increased trade tensions and a breakdown of global trade norms, which would be destabilizing for the global economy.

- **Immunity Ruling Implications:** The immunity ruling's potential amplification of these plans could result in fewer checks and balances on the administration's actions in trade policy. This could lead to a lack of accountability and transparency in the implementation of trade policies, making it easier for the government to pursue aggressive and potentially harmful policies without oversight.

#### Conclusion Statement  
The subsection "The Case for Free Trade" presents a vision of trade policy that prioritizes free trade and minimal government intervention, with a focus on traditional conservative values. However, this perspective raises concerns about the exclusion of important social and environmental considerations, potential deregulation, and a confrontational approach to international trade. The implications of the immunity ruling could further exacerbate these issues by reducing oversight and accountability. The overall impact of these policies could lead to reduced protections for workers and the environment, increased economic inequality, and heightened global trade tensions. It is crucial to consider the broader consequences of such a narrow approach to trade policy and ensure that trade agreements reflect a balance of economic, social, and environmental priorities.

## <span id="nutshell">"The Case for Free Trade" in a Nutshell</span>

This section from Project 2025, titled "The Case for Free Trade," presents a vision of trade policy rooted in conservative principles. It emphasizes minimal government intervention, the importance of free markets, and skepticism toward the inclusion of non-trade issues, such as labor and environmental standards, in trade agreements. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key topics and concerns discussed:

### Key Proposals and Their Implications

1. **Repealing Tariffs and Sections 232, 201, and 301**: 
   - The proposal advocates for removing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and Chinese goods, arguing that these tariffs harm consumers and American businesses. While removing tariffs could lower consumer prices, the concern is that it might expose American industries to unfair competition, particularly from China, which has a history of engaging in practices like dumping and intellectual property theft. This could lead to job losses in manufacturing sectors that rely on these protections.

2. **Repealing the Jones Act**: 
   - The Jones Act requires that goods transported between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-built, owned, and crewed ships. The proposal suggests repealing it to lower shipping costs and boost trade. However, repealing the act could weaken national security by making the U.S. more dependent on foreign ships, which might not be reliable in times of conflict or trade disputes. Additionally, it could further erode the U.S. maritime industry, leading to job losses and a decline in shipbuilding capabilities.

3. **Closing the Export-Import Bank (EXIM)**:
   - EXIM primarily benefits a few large corporations, with Boeing being a major beneficiary. The proposal argues for closing EXIM, stating that it serves special interests and has been co-opted for progressive policy goals. Closing EXIM could disadvantage small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that rely on it for financing to compete internationally, potentially weakening U.S. exports and reducing the country's influence in global markets.

4. **Restoring or Replacing the WTO Dispute Resolution Process**: 
   - The proposal suggests either restoring the World Trade Organizationâ€™s dispute resolution process or replacing it with a new system limited to liberal democracies. While this could strengthen trade relations among like-minded countries, it could also lead to the fragmentation of the global trading system, isolating the U.S. from important markets and reducing its influence in shaping global trade norms.

### Major Concerns

- **Economic Dislocation and Job Losses**: 
   - The push for free trade overlooks the potential economic dislocation, particularly in industries unable to compete with cheaper imports. The lack of adequate support for displaced workers, such as retraining programs, raises concerns about increased unemployment and economic inequality.

- **Neglect of Environmental and Labor Standards**: 
   - The resistance to incorporating environmental and labor standards into trade agreements could lead to a "race to the bottom," where countries lower protections to attract business, resulting in environmental degradation and exploitation of workers.

- **Geopolitical Risks**: 
   - The emphasis on leveraging trade agreements for geopolitical influence, particularly in relation to China, could lead to accusations of economic imperialism and increased international tensions.

- **Undermining National Sovereignty**: 
   - The strong stance against protectionism might ignore the growing sentiment of economic nationalism and concerns about national sovereignty. This could lead to political backlash from domestic constituencies who feel their jobs and industries are being sacrificed for global trade.

- **Insufficient Worker Support**: 
   - The document does not adequately address the need for support systems for workers and communities affected by trade liberalization. Without measures such as retraining programs and unemployment benefits, the negative impacts of free trade could exacerbate social inequalities.

- **Potential Erosion of Consumer Protections**: 
   - The push to reduce tariffs and regulatory barriers might lead to lower safety standards for products, posing risks to consumer health and safety.

### Conclusion

"The Case for Free Trade" presents a vision of trade policy that prioritizes free trade and minimal government intervention, reflecting traditional conservative values. However, this approach raises several concerns, including the potential for economic dislocation, neglect of environmental and labor standards, and geopolitical risks. The proposals, while aimed at boosting the U.S. economy and reducing government involvement, could lead to significant social and economic challenges if not carefully managed. The section underscores the need for a balanced approach to trade policy that considers not only economic benefits but also the broader social, environmental, and geopolitical implications.
