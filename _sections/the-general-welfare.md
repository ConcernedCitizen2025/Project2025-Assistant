# "The General Welfare" *Between the Lines*

**Summary:**
Section Three of Project 2025, titled "The General Welfare," focuses on a range of federal departments and agencies, critiquing their roles in contributing to what the authors perceive as excessive government overreach and inefficiency. The section argues that many of these agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Education, and others, have deviated from their core missions and have been politicized under recent administrations. The recommendations call for a significant scaling back of federal power, a return to more traditional values, and an emphasis on individual and state rights.

**In-Depth Analysis:**

1. **Critique of HHS and Proposals for Reform:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The document argues that the HHS has become a massive bureaucracy that contributes significantly to the national debt, particularly through Medicare and Medicaid. It criticizes the agency for its role during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially regarding mask mandates and vaccine policies, and calls for a reversal of these policies. It also advocates for ending the agency's involvement in gender-related issues and abortion, emphasizing the need to promote traditional family values.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While addressing fiscal concerns is important, the broad critiques of HHS could lead to undermining essential health services for millions of Americans. The focus on reversing gender and reproductive rights policies might result in reduced access to critical health services for vulnerable populations, including women and the LGBTQ+ community. The proposed rollback of COVID-19 measures could also disregard scientific evidence and public health expertise, potentially putting public health at risk.
   - **Potential Consequences:** Implementing these changes could lead to increased health disparities, particularly among marginalized groups. The emphasis on traditional family values over comprehensive health care could also alienate large segments of the population and reduce trust in the federal government’s role in protecting public health.

2. **Reforming the Department of Justice (DOJ):**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The section criticizes the DOJ for what it describes as the politicization and weaponization of its powers under recent administrations. It calls for the DOJ to refocus on its core mission of protecting public safety and defending the rule of law, and suggests reforms to the FBI to reduce its independence and bring it more directly under the control of the Attorney General.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While restoring public trust in the DOJ is crucial, the proposals to reduce the FBI's independence could undermine the agency’s ability to conduct impartial investigations, particularly in politically sensitive cases. The emphasis on "viewpoint-based prosecutions" suggests a desire to curtail investigations or prosecutions that might be seen as politically inconvenient, which could compromise the integrity of the justice system.
   - **Potential Consequences:** Reducing the FBI’s independence could lead to increased political interference in law enforcement, undermining the rule of law. This could result in a loss of public confidence in the justice system and a perception that the DOJ is being used as a tool for political retribution rather than impartial justice.

3. **Department of Education and the Call for Closure:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The document calls for the closure of the Department of Education, arguing that education should be managed at the state and local levels. It criticizes the department for promoting what it describes as a "woke" agenda, including issues related to gender identity and systemic racism, and advocates for returning control of education to parents and local communities.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While local control of education is a longstanding debate, the complete closure of the Department of Education could lead to significant disparities in educational quality across states. Without federal oversight, there could be a reduction in support for disadvantaged students, and educational standards might vary widely, potentially exacerbating inequality. The critique of "woke" agendas could also limit the inclusion of diverse perspectives and critical discussions in education.
   - **Potential Consequences:** Eliminating the Department of Education could result in a fragmented education system with significant gaps in quality and access. This could particularly impact students in low-income areas or states with fewer resources, leading to greater educational inequality and limiting opportunities for social mobility.

4. **Critique and Proposed Reforms for the Department of Energy:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The section argues for ending the Biden Administration’s focus on renewable energy and restoring the country’s reliance on fossil fuels. It calls for the repeal of regulations promoting electric vehicles and renewable energy sources, advocating instead for policies that support traditional energy industries.
   - **Concerning Implications:** Reversing the shift toward renewable energy could have significant environmental and economic impacts. Continuing reliance on fossil fuels contributes to climate change, which poses long-term risks to both the environment and public health. The rollback of regulations supporting electric vehicles could also slow progress toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality.
   - **Potential Consequences:** The proposed energy policies could lead to increased carbon emissions and a setback in the fight against climate change. This could also harm the U.S.’s standing in global climate initiatives and reduce its competitiveness in the growing renewable energy sector. Additionally, the focus on fossil fuels may neglect the economic opportunities presented by clean energy technologies.

5. **Scaling Back the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The document calls for reducing the scope and power of the EPA, arguing that the agency has exceeded its congressional mandates and has become overly coercive. It suggests rolling back regulations that are seen as burdensome to businesses, particularly those related to environmental protections.
   - **Concerning Implications:** Reducing the EPA's regulatory power could weaken environmental protections that are critical for public health and the preservation of natural resources. The rollback of regulations might benefit certain industries in the short term but could lead to long-term environmental degradation and public health issues, such as air and water pollution.
   - **Potential Consequences:** Weakening the EPA could result in increased pollution and environmental harm, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities. It could also undermine efforts to combat climate change and protect biodiversity, leading to broader ecological and public health challenges.

**Conclusion Statement:**
The proposals outlined in the "The General Welfare" section of Project 2025 reflect a broader agenda to reduce federal power and return control to states and individuals. While these recommendations aim to address concerns about government overreach and inefficiency, they raise significant concerns about the potential impacts on public health, education, the environment, and justice. The proposed reforms could lead to increased inequality, reduced protections for vulnerable populations, and a retreat from important advancements in areas such as environmental protection and public health. As these policies are considered, it is crucial to carefully weigh their potential consequences and ensure that they do not undermine the principles of equity, justice, and the common good that are foundational to American democracy.

## Potential Concerns: The General Welfare

### Diminished Federal Support
The call for reducing the scope of federal agencies may lead to decreased support for programs that benefit vulnerable populations, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and social services.

### Politicization of Science and Public Health
The dismissal of certain scientific and public health measures, such as mask mandates and vaccine policies, raises concerns about the politicization of science and potential public health risks.

### Erosion of Social Progress
The criticism of policies related to LGBTQ+ rights, gender issues, and racial equity suggests a rollback of social progress and protections for marginalized groups.

### Overemphasis on State Control
While advocating for state and local control, the approach may lead to inconsistent policies across states, potentially exacerbating inequalities and limiting access to essential services.

## Breaking Down the Concerns: The General Welfare  

- **Less Federal Aid:** Less support from federal programs could hurt vulnerable people.

- **Ignoring Science:** Downplaying science and health measures could put public health at risk.

- **Rolling Back Rights:** Reducing protections for LGBTQ+ and racial minorities could undo progress.

- **Inconsistent Policies:** Different rules in different states could lead to unequal access to services.

## <span id="redflags">Red Flags in the Reforms: Analyzing Troubling Quotes</span>

- ***Quote:** "HHS is home to Medicare and Medicaid, the principal drivers of our $31 trillion national debt. When Congress passed and President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law these programs, they were set on autopilot with no plan for how to pay for them" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 266).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The text blames Medicare and Medicaid for significantly contributing to the national debt, criticizing their lack of financial planning.

    - **Explanation:** This quote presents a critique of Medicare and Medicaid, suggesting they are major contributors to the national debt. While it is true that these programs are expensive, they also provide essential healthcare services to millions of Americans. The implication that these programs are unsustainable without offering viable alternatives could lead to calls for cuts or restructuring that may reduce access to healthcare for the elderly and low-income individuals.

- ***Quote:** "All along, it was clear from randomized controlled trials—the gold standard of medical research—that masks provide little to no benefit in preventing the spread of viruses and might even be counterproductive. Yet the CDC ignored these high-quality RCTs, cherry-picked from politically malleable 'observational studies,' and declared that everyone except children and infants below the age of two should don masks" (Project 2025, p 266).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote criticizes the CDC's recommendations on mask-wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming that the agency ignored more reliable scientific evidence.

    - **Explanation:** This statement reflects a distrust in the CDC's guidance and an accusation of politicization within the agency. By suggesting that the CDC cherry-picked studies to support a specific narrative, the quote undermines public trust in public health recommendations. The criticism of mask mandates also downplays the protective measures taken during a public health crisis. This stance could fuel public resistance to necessary health interventions, making it challenging to manage future public health emergencies. Moreover, it could pave the way for reducing the authority and funding of public health institutions, potentially compromising their ability to respond effectively to future crises.

- ***Quote:** "In essence, our deficit problem is a Medicare and Medicaid problem" (Project 2025, p 266).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote suggests that the U.S. deficit is primarily due to spending on Medicare and Medicaid.

    - **Explanation:** This assertion simplifies the complex issue of national debt by attributing it largely to spending on essential healthcare programs. By framing Medicare and Medicaid as the primary contributors to the deficit, the statement may be setting the stage for advocating significant cuts to these programs. Such reductions could have severe consequences for millions of Americans who depend on these services for their healthcare needs. The focus on deficit reduction through cuts to social safety nets overlooks other factors contributing to the national debt and may disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.

- ***Quote:** "When our Founders wrote in the Constitution that the federal government would 'promote the general Welfare,' they could not have fathomed a massive bureaucracy that would someday spend $3 trillion in a single year—roughly the sum, combined, spent by the departments covered in this section in 2022. Approximately half of that colossal sum was spent by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) alone—the belly of the massive behemoth that is the modern administrative state" (Project 2025, p 266).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote critiques the large scale of federal spending, particularly highlighting the Department of Health and Human Services as emblematic of an overly large bureaucracy.

    - **Explanation:** This statement raises concerns about the framing of federal spending on welfare as excessively burdensome. By characterizing the administrative state as a "massive behemoth," the quote suggests a negative view of government involvement in providing services such as healthcare and social welfare. This perspective may reflect an intent to reduce government spending on crucial social programs, potentially leading to cuts in services that many Americans rely on for health and well-being. The critique of bureaucracy can also imply a push for privatization or deregulation, which could impact the quality and accessibility of services provided by the government.

- ***Quote:** "The CDC exposed itself as 'perhaps the most incompetent and arrogant agency in the federal government.' Nor is the CDC the only villain in this play. Severino writes of the National Institutes of Health, 'Despite its popular image as a benign science agency, NIH was responsible for paying for research in aborted baby body parts, human animal chimera experiments'... the CDC ignored these high-quality RCTs, cherry-picked from politically malleable 'observational studies,' and declared that everyone except children and infants below the age of two should don masks" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 267).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The text harshly criticizes the CDC and NIH for their roles during the COVID-19 pandemic, accusing them of incompetence and unethical research practices.

    - **Explanation:** This statement harshly criticizes key public health agencies, undermining their credibility and the public's trust in scientific and medical expertise. By framing these agencies as villains, the text dismisses the complexities and challenges faced during the pandemic. The references to controversial research practices are likely intended to further discredit these institutions, potentially leading to reduced public support for scientific research and public health initiatives.

- ***Quote:** "The next secretary should also reverse the Biden Administration’s focus on 'LGBTQ+ equity,' subsidizing single-motherhood, disincentivizing work, and penalizing marriage, replacing such policies with those encouraging marriage, work, motherhood, fatherhood, and nuclear families" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 267).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The quote suggests reversing policies that promote LGBTQ+ equity and support for single mothers, advocating instead for traditional family structures and work incentives.

    - **Explanation:** This statement indicates a clear opposition to policies supporting LGBTQ+ individuals and single parents, advocating for traditional family values instead. Such a stance risks marginalizing non-traditional family structures and individuals who do not conform to these norms. The emphasis on traditional gender roles and family structures could lead to reduced support for diverse family forms and potentially harmful policies that do not acknowledge the realities of modern family dynamics.

- ***Quote:** "As Severino writes, 'Funding for scientific research should not be controlled by a small group of highly paid and unaccountable insiders at the NIH, many of whom stay in power for decades. The NIH monopoly on directing research should be broken'" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 267).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The text argues against the centralized control of research funding by NIH insiders, advocating for more accountability and transparency.

    - **Explanation:** While the call for transparency and accountability in research funding is valid, the portrayal of NIH officials as "unaccountable insiders" is concerning. It risks undermining the expertise and independence of scientific research, potentially opening the door for political interference in the direction of research. Such changes could prioritize politically favorable research topics over those determined by scientific merit and public health needs.

- ***Quote:** "The next Secretary of Energy will similarly have much work to do. Under the next President, the Department of Energy should end the Biden Administration’s unprovoked war on fossil fuels, restore America’s energy independence, oppose eyesore windmills built at taxpayer expense, and respect the right of Americans to buy and drive cars of their own choosing, rather than trying to force them into electric vehicles and eventually out of the driver’s seat altogether in favor of self-driving robots" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 269).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The text criticizes the Biden Administration's energy policies, advocating for the end of restrictions on fossil fuels and opposing forced adoption of electric vehicles.

    - **Explanation:** The strong language against renewable energy initiatives and the emphasis on fossil fuels reflect a prioritization of short-term economic interests over long-term environmental sustainability. The dismissal of renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power, as "eyesores" funded by taxpayers ignores the broader benefits of transitioning to cleaner energy. This perspective could hinder progress on climate change mitigation and lead to continued environmental degradation.

- ***Quote:** "The DOJ’s longstanding reputation has been marred by the Biden Administration’s abuse of the department’s powers for its own ends. Hamilton writes that the department’s 'unprecedented politicization and weaponization' under Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, resulting in 'politically motivated and viewpoint-based prosecutions' of political enemies and indifference to the crimes of political allies, has made the department 'a threat to the Republic'" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 267-268).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The text accuses the DOJ under the Biden Administration of politicization and using its power for political purposes, threatening the Republic.

    - **Explanation:** Accusing the DOJ of politicization and weaponization is a serious allegation that questions the integrity of the department. Such rhetoric can erode public trust in the justice system and create a perception of bias and unfairness. The suggestion that the DOJ is a "threat to the Republic" under the current administration is inflammatory and risks deepening political divisions. It implies that a new administration must take drastic measures to rectify these perceived issues, which could include sweeping changes that undermine the department's independence and impartiality.

### Conclusion
The quotes from the "General Welfare" section of Project 2025 underscore a strong ideological stance favoring limited government and traditional values. The criticisms of Medicare and Medicaid, as well as public health agencies like the CDC and NIH, reveal a perspective that views these institutions as excessively powerful and financially burdensome. The narrative portrays these agencies as pushing controversial policies, such as LGBTQ+ equity and progressive health measures, which the text frames as detrimental to traditional American values and fiscal responsibility.

The implications of the immunity ruling, which potentially shields government officials from legal consequences for their actions, could exacerbate these concerns. This legal protection might embolden an administration to implement radical changes without fear of judicial or public accountability, potentially dismantling established social safety nets and regulatory frameworks. The proposed rollbacks of public health measures, support for diverse family structures, and environmental protections suggest a move towards a more conservative, less inclusive governance model.

These red flags indicate a potential shift away from inclusive and evidence-based policymaking towards a governance style that prioritizes ideological conformity and market-based solutions. The broad dismissal of scientific consensus and progressive social policies risks marginalizing vulnerable groups and undermining public trust in essential government institutions. The overarching concern is that the implementation of such an agenda, coupled with the protection from legal scrutiny, could lead to significant societal upheaval and a rollback of decades of social and environmental progress.

## <span id="nutshell">“The General Welfare” in a Nutshell</span>

Section Three of Project 2025, titled "The General Welfare," provides a critique of multiple federal departments and agencies, arguing that they have become overly bloated, inefficient, and politicized under recent administrations. The section suggests a significant scaling back of federal power, with an emphasis on returning control to states, promoting traditional values, and reducing the federal budget. Here’s a breakdown of the major concerns highlighted in this section:

### Critique of Health and Human Services (HHS)
The section portrays HHS as a major contributor to the national debt, particularly through Medicare and Medicaid. It criticizes these programs for lacking a sustainable financial plan and blames them for the bulk of the federal deficit. Additionally, the section attacks HHS’s role during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically targeting mask and vaccine mandates, and accuses the CDC and NIH of incompetence and corruption. The section also calls for a reversal of policies related to gender issues, abortion, and LGBTQ+ equity, advocating instead for policies that encourage traditional family values.

**Concerns:** The proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid could severely impact vulnerable populations who rely on these programs for healthcare. The rollback of public health measures and a dismissal of scientific expertise could undermine future pandemic responses. Moreover, the emphasis on traditional family values and the rejection of gender and LGBTQ+ equity initiatives might marginalize already vulnerable groups, leading to increased health disparities and reduced access to essential services.

### Reforming the Department of Justice (DOJ)
The DOJ is criticized for being politicized and weaponized under the Biden administration. The section calls for the DOJ to focus on its core mission of public safety and rule of law while reducing the independence of the FBI. It suggests reforms to ensure that the DOJ does not engage in what is perceived as politically motivated prosecutions.

**Concerns:** Reducing the FBI’s independence could lead to increased political interference in law enforcement, undermining impartial investigations and eroding public trust in the justice system. The focus on reversing what is seen as politicization could lead to biased enforcement of laws, favoring certain political agendas over the impartial application of justice.

### Department of Education: Call for Closure
The section argues for the closure of the Department of Education, stating that education should be managed at the state and local levels. It criticizes the department for promoting a "woke" agenda, including gender identity and systemic racism, and suggests returning control of education to parents and local communities.

**Concerns:** Eliminating the Department of Education could lead to significant disparities in educational quality across states, exacerbating inequality and limiting access to resources for disadvantaged students. The removal of federal oversight could also reduce the inclusion of diverse perspectives in education, potentially leading to a less informed and more divided society.

### Energy Policy: Reversing Climate Initiatives
The section advocates for ending the Biden administration’s focus on renewable energy, calling for a return to fossil fuels to restore energy independence. It opposes regulations promoting electric vehicles and renewable energy sources, favoring traditional energy industries instead.

**Concerns:** Reversing climate initiatives could have severe environmental and economic consequences. Continued reliance on fossil fuels would contribute to climate change, potentially leading to long-term public health and environmental crises. The rollback of renewable energy policies could also hinder the U.S.’s ability to compete in the growing global clean energy market, reducing economic opportunities in this sector.

### Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Other Agencies
The section argues for scaling back the EPA, claiming it has exceeded its congressional mandates and become overly coercive. It calls for a reduction in environmental regulations that are seen as burdensome to businesses. Similarly, other departments, such as Agriculture and Housing, are critiqued for "mission creep" and for being influenced by left-wing agendas.

**Concerns:** Weakening the EPA could lead to increased pollution and environmental harm, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities. The reduction in regulations might benefit certain industries in the short term but could result in long-term environmental degradation. The push to roll back progressive policies across various departments could also lead to a reduction in protections for marginalized groups, exacerbating social and economic inequalities.

### Conclusion
The proposals outlined in "The General Welfare" section reflect a broader agenda to reduce federal government involvement in areas such as healthcare, education, environmental protection, and social justice. While these recommendations aim to address concerns about government overreach and fiscal responsibility, they raise significant concerns about the potential impacts on public health, education, the environment, and social equity. The emphasis on traditional values and state control may lead to increased inequality, reduced protections for vulnerable populations, and a retreat from important advancements in public health, environmental protection, and social justice.
