# "Central Personnel Agencies: Managing the Bureaucracy" *Between the Lines*

**Summary:**
Section 1.3 of Project 2025, titled "Central Personnel Agencies: Managing the Bureaucracy," focuses on the critical role of personnel management within the federal government. The section emphasizes that "personnel is policy," meaning that the people appointed to federal positions directly influence the direction and implementation of the President’s agenda. It details the roles of key personnel agencies, such as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), in managing the federal workforce.

The section also discusses challenges within the current system, such as the difficulty of removing underperforming federal employees, the problems associated with performance appraisals, and the complexities of the appeals process. It proposes reforms aimed at making the federal workforce more accountable, efficient, and aligned with the President's vision, including the potential reintroduction of "Schedule F" to streamline hiring and firing practices for federal employees.

**In-Depth Analysis and Constitutional Concerns:**

1. **"Personnel is Policy" Philosophy:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The section emphasizes that the President’s ability to implement his agenda hinges on who occupies federal positions. It stresses the importance of the President having the authority to appoint, direct, and remove personnel to ensure alignment with his policy goals.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While it is true that personnel decisions impact policy, this philosophy could lead to a federal workforce that is overly politicized, where loyalty to the President takes precedence over qualifications and expertise. This could undermine the merit-based principles that have traditionally governed federal employment, leading to a less effective and more partisan bureaucracy.
   - **Potential Consequences:** The risk of prioritizing political loyalty over merit could result in less competent administration, as well as increased turnover and instability within federal agencies. This could weaken the overall effectiveness of the government and erode public trust in federal institutions.

2. **Reintroduction of Schedule F:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The section discusses the potential reintroduction of Schedule F, a category of federal employees who can be hired and fired more easily based on political considerations. This proposal aims to make it easier for the President to remove career civil servants who are not aligned with his agenda.
   - **Concerning Implications:** Reintroducing Schedule F could significantly weaken the protections that career civil servants have against political interference. This could lead to a federal workforce that is more susceptible to political pressure and less able to provide impartial, evidence-based advice. It could also undermine the stability and continuity of government operations, as employees may be more likely to be dismissed for political reasons rather than for performance-related issues.
   - **Potential Consequences:** The use of Schedule F could politicize the federal workforce, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge and a decrease in the effectiveness of government agencies. It could also create a chilling effect, where civil servants are hesitant to speak out against policies or actions they believe to be wrong, for fear of losing their jobs.
   - **Constitutional Conflict:** The reintroduction of Schedule F could conflict with the principles of a merit-based civil service as established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act and the underlying principles of Article I, Section 8, which grants Congress the power to establish and maintain a federal workforce.

3. **Challenges in Removing Underperforming Employees:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The section highlights the difficulty of removing underperforming federal employees due to a cumbersome appeals process and overly protective personnel policies. It advocates for reforms that would streamline the process of disciplining or removing employees who fail to meet performance standards.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While it is important to address underperformance in the federal workforce, overly aggressive reforms could lead to a system where employees are removed without due process or proper evaluation. This could result in a workforce that is less secure, leading to lower morale and a decrease in the quality of public service.
   - **Potential Consequences:** The potential consequences include an increase in unfair dismissals and a reduction in job security for federal employees. This could make it harder to attract and retain talented individuals in the federal workforce, ultimately impacting the effectiveness of government operations.

4. **Performance Appraisals and Merit Pay:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The section advocates for improving the performance appraisal system and tying pay and promotions more closely to performance rather than seniority. It suggests that current performance evaluations are overly generous and do not accurately reflect employee performance, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of accountability.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While performance-based pay can incentivize good work, there is a risk that such systems can be manipulated or misused, especially in a politicized environment. If performance evaluations are not conducted fairly or transparently, they could lead to favoritism and discrimination, rather than genuinely rewarding merit.
   - **Potential Consequences:** The potential consequences include a workforce that feels demoralized or unfairly treated if performance evaluations are not conducted properly. This could result in decreased productivity and increased turnover, further weakening the effectiveness of the federal government.

5. **Impact of Public-Sector Unions:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The section discusses the challenges posed by public-sector unions, which it argues can hinder effective personnel management and contribute to the difficulty of removing underperforming employees. It suggests that the influence of unions should be curtailed to improve government efficiency.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While it is true that unions can sometimes complicate personnel management, they also play a crucial role in protecting the rights of employees and ensuring fair treatment. Curtailing union influence could weaken these protections, leading to a workforce that is more vulnerable to exploitation and political pressure.
   - **Potential Consequences:** The potential consequences include a reduction in employee rights and protections, which could lead to a less motivated and less secure workforce. This could ultimately harm the quality of public services provided by the federal government.

**Conclusion Statement:**
Section 1.3 of Project 2025 outlines a vision for managing the federal bureaucracy that emphasizes the importance of aligning the federal workforce with the President's agenda. While the proposals aim to make the government more efficient and responsive, they raise significant concerns about the potential for politicization of the federal workforce, the erosion of merit-based hiring and promotion practices, and the weakening of employee protections. The reintroduction of Schedule F, in particular, poses a risk to the independence and effectiveness of the civil service. As these reforms are considered, it is essential to balance the need for accountability and efficiency with the need to preserve the integrity, impartiality, and stability of the federal workforce.

## Potential Concerns: Central Personnel Agencies-Managing the Bureaucracy
The "Central Personnel Agencies: Managing the Bureaucracy" subsection of Project 2025 introduces a number of reforms aimed at enhancing the efficiency, accountability, and performance of the federal workforce. While these goals are laudable, several potential concerns arise from the proposed changes:

### Overemphasis on Private-Sector Practices
The heavy reliance on private-sector best practices to improve recruitment and reduce red tape could undermine the unique aspects of public service. The federal government's mission-driven nature and its need for public accountability differ significantly from private enterprises. Implementing private-sector methods without adequate adaptation to the public sector context may lead to a disregard for the principles of merit-based hiring and equitable treatment.

### Risks of Increased Flexibility in Employee Removal
While flexibility in removing underperforming employees aims to maintain a high-performance workforce, it poses risks if not carefully balanced with protections against arbitrary dismissals. There is a potential for misuse of this flexibility, leading to politically motivated or unjust removals. Ensuring that performance evaluations are fair, transparent, and based on objective criteria is crucial to prevent such abuses.

### Adequate Funding and Implementation of IT Modernization
Modernizing OPM’s IT infrastructure to streamline personnel management processes is necessary but requires substantial funding, effective implementation, and ongoing updates. Without these, the
initiative may fail to deliver the intended improvements in transparency and efficiency, potentially resulting in wasted resources and unmet objectives.

### Balance Between Efficiency and Employee Rights at MSPB
Streamlining MSPB processes to expedite dispute resolution could compromise the thoroughness and fairness of the adjudication process if not carefully managed. The use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods must ensure that employees' rights are protected and that the merit system’s integrity is maintained. A focus solely on efficiency might undermine the trust employees place in the system.

### Potential Undermining of Union Protections by FLRA Reforms
Revising labor policies and collective bargaining agreements to enhance managerial flexibility could weaken the role of unions and reduce the protections they offer federal employees. This might lead to a decline in workforce morale and productivity if employees feel their rights are being compromised. Balancing managerial needs with employee rights is critical to maintaining a fair and effective labor-management environment.

### Over-Reliance on Quantitative Performance Metrics
Emphasizing performance management through clear metrics and evaluation systems could lead to an over-reliance on quantitative measures. Such metrics might not fully capture an employee’s contributions, particularly in roles where qualitative aspects are significant. This narrow focus could result in skewed assessments that fail to recognize the full scope of employees’ performance.

### Challenges in Implementing Administrative Flexibility and Innovation
While promoting administrative flexibility and innovation is a forward-thinking approach, it requires a supportive organizational culture and sufficient resources. There are risks associated with implementing pilot programs without robust mechanisms to evaluate their effectiveness. Failure to properly assess these initiatives could lead to ineffective or counterproductive management strategies being scaled up.

### Risks in Reducing Bureaucratic Red Tape
The objective of reducing bureaucratic red tape is generally positive, but the process must be conducted carefully to avoid eliminating essential safeguards. Identifying and removing unnecessary regulations should involve comprehensive input from various stakeholders to ensure that critical protections are not compromised. An overly aggressive approach could lead to gaps in accountability and oversight.

### Impact on Gender and LGBTQ+ Protections
The proposal to eliminate the Gender Policy Council and shift focus to promoting life and family values might reduce support for gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights. This change could exacerbate existing disparities and roll back progress made in addressing gender-based and LGBTQ+ discrimination. Vulnerable populations might find themselves without the necessary advocacy and protection.

### Conclusion
While the proposed reforms in the "Central Personnel Agencies: Managing the Bureaucracy" subsection aim to enhance the efficiency and accountability of the federal workforce, they also introduce several potential concerns. Balancing private-sector practices with public sector principles, protecting employee rights, ensuring fair performance evaluations, maintaining union protections, and carefully reducing bureaucratic red tape are essential to avoid unintended negative consequences. Addressing these concerns will be crucial to successfully implementing the proposed reforms and achieving a more effective federal bureaucracy.

## Breaking Down the Concerns: Central Personnel Agencies-Managing the Bureaucracy

- **Overemphasis on Private-Sector Practices**: The heavy focus on private-sector methods might not fit well with the unique needs of the federal government. Public service has different accountability and mission-driven goals, and applying business practices without adjustments could harm fair hiring and equitable treatment.

- **Risks of Increased Flexibility in Employee Removal**: Allowing more flexibility in firing employees could lead to unfair dismissals if not properly regulated. There's a risk that this flexibility might be abused for political or arbitrary reasons, undermining trust in the system.

- **Adequate Funding and Implementation of IT Modernization**: Upgrading OPM’s IT systems is crucial but requires significant funding and careful implementation. Without adequate resources and continuous updates, the modernization effort might fail, leading to wasted money and unachieved goals.

- **Balance Between Efficiency and Employee Rights at MSPB**: Speeding up the MSPB’s dispute resolution process is important, but it must not compromise fairness. If the focus is only on efficiency, employees’ rights might be neglected, leading to a loss of trust in the merit system.

- **Potential Undermining of Union Protections by FLRA Reforms**: Changes to labor policies could weaken union protections for federal employees. This might lower morale and productivity if employees feel their rights are being compromised, highlighting the need to balance management flexibility with employee rights.

- **Over-Reliance on Quantitative Performance Metrics**: Using clear performance metrics is good, but relying too much on numbers might miss important qualitative aspects of an employee's work. This narrow focus can lead to unfair evaluations that don't fully recognize all contributions.

- **Challenges in Implementing Administrative Flexibility and Innovation**: Promoting flexibility and innovation is positive but requires a supportive culture and sufficient resources. Without proper evaluation, pilot programs might not work well and could lead to ineffective strategies being widely adopted.

- **Risks in Reducing Bureaucratic Red Tape**: Cutting unnecessary regulations is beneficial, but it must be done carefully to avoid removing essential safeguards. An aggressive approach could lead to accountability gaps, so stakeholder input is crucial to ensure important protections remain intact.

- **Impact on Gender and LGBTQ+ Protections**: Eliminating the Gender Policy Council could reduce support for gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights. This move might increase disparities and roll back progress in addressing discrimination, leaving vulnerable populations without necessary protection and advocacy.

## <span id="redflags">Red Flags in the Reform:</span> Analyzing Troubling Quotes

- ***Quote:**: "The creation of the Senior Executive Service was the top career change introduced by the 1978 Carter–Campbell Civil Service Reform Act. Its aim was to professionalize the career service and make it more responsible to the democratically elected commander in chief and his political appointees while respecting the rights due to career employees, very much including those in the top positions. The new SES would allow management to be more flexible in filling and reassigning executive positions and locations beyond narrow specialties for more efficient mission accomplishment and would provide pay and large bonuses to motivate career performance" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 73).*

    - **Summarize Quote:**: The Senior Executive Service (SES) was established to professionalize the civil service and align it with the President's agenda, while also providing flexibility and incentives for management.

    - **Explanation:**: This description of the SES's purpose raises concerns about the potential for politicization within the civil service. The emphasis on aligning the service with the President's agenda could lead to prioritizing political loyalty over professional qualifications and expertise. This risks undermining the independence of the civil service, which is meant to serve the public impartially. The mention of providing "pay and large bonuses" as motivation could also incentivize compliance with political directives, potentially at the expense of ethical standards and accountability.

- ***Quote:**: "The desire to infiltrate political appointees improperly into the high career civil service has been widespread in every Administration, whether Democrat or Republican. Democratic Administrations, however, are typically more successful because they require the cooperation of careerists, who generally lean heavily to the Left" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 73).*

    - **Summarize Quote:**: There is a history of administrations, particularly Democratic ones, successfully placing political appointees in career civil service positions by cooperating with left-leaning careerists.

    - **Explanation:**: The use of the term "infiltrate" suggests a covert or improper action, indicating an attempt to insert political appointees into career positions that are supposed to be apolitical. This practice is troubling as it can compromise the nonpartisan nature of the civil service, leading to decisions being made based on political affiliations rather than merit or public interest. The statement's implication that one political ideology predominates in the career civil service could be used to justify purging or altering the composition of the civil service to align with a particular political agenda, undermining the principle of an impartial and professional government workforce.

- ***Quote:**: "The Trump Administration issued Executive Order 13957 to make career professionals in positions that are not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition but who discharge significant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating and implementing executive branch policy and programs an exception to the competitive hiring rules and examinations for career positions under a new Schedule F" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 74).*

    - **Summarize Quote:**: Executive Order 13957 aimed to reclassify certain career positions under a new Schedule F, exempting them from competitive hiring rules and examinations.

    - **Explanation:**: This order essentially sought to create a new category of federal employees—Schedule F—who could be hired and fired more easily based on political considerations rather than merit. This reclassification undermines the principles of a merit-based civil service by potentially subjecting key positions to political influence. The removal of competitive hiring safeguards threatens the integrity and professionalism of the civil service, as it opens the door to hiring individuals based on loyalty to the administration rather than qualifications. This change could lead to a workforce that is less independent and more beholden to the political whims of the administration, eroding the foundational principles of fair and impartial government service.

- ***Quote:** "As the U.S. Constitution makes clear, the President’s appointment, direction, and removal authorities are the central elements of his executive power. In implementing that power, the people and the President deserve the most talented and responsible workforce possible" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 63).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The President has the authority to appoint, direct, and remove personnel to ensure a competent workforce.

    - **Explanation:** While the President’s power to manage personnel is constitutional, this statement emphasizes centralizing control, which could lead to potential overreach. The risk is that it might prioritize loyalty over competence, affecting the merit-based system meant to ensure the most qualified individuals are in positions of power. Centralizing too much power in the executive branch can undermine checks and balances, leading to politicization of the civil service.

- ***Quote:** "Who the President assigns to design and implement his political policy agenda will determine whether he can carry out the responsibility given to him by the American people. The President must recognize that whoever holds a government position sets its policy. To fulfill an electoral mandate, he must therefore give personnel management his highest priority, including Cabinet-level precedence" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 63).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The President’s appointees shape policy and thus require high priority in personnel management.

    - **Explanation:** This quote stresses the importance of personnel in implementing the President’s agenda. However, it also suggests a potential for prioritizing political alignment over expertise. This approach could lead to the appointment of individuals based on political loyalty rather than qualifications, undermining the effectiveness and neutrality of government operations. 

- ***Quote:** "The modern merit system increasingly made it almost impossible to fire all but the most incompetent civil servants. Complying with arcane rules regarding recruiting, rating, hiring, and firing simply replaced the goal of cultivating competence and expertise" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 65).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** The merit system has made it difficult to dismiss civil servants, complicating efforts to ensure competence.

    - **Explanation:** Criticizing the merit system for protecting underperforming employees suggests a desire to streamline dismissal processes. While accountability is important, the proposed changes could erode job security and fairness, potentially leading to unjust dismissals and a demoralized workforce. This could also discourage public service careers, affecting the overall quality of the civil service.

- ***Quote:** "In the 1970s, Georgia Democratic Governor Jimmy Carter, then a political unknown, ran for President supporting New Deal programs and their Great Society expansion but opposing the way they were being administered. The policies were not actually reducing poverty, increasing prosperity, or improving the environment, he argued, and to make them work required fundamental bureaucratic reform" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 65).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** Jimmy Carter supported New Deal programs but criticized their administration, advocating for bureaucratic reform.

    - **Explanation:** Highlighting historical calls for reform suggests an ongoing need for efficiency improvements. However, framing these reforms as essential to policy success may downplay the complexities of governance and the importance of a balanced approach that ensures both efficiency and fairness. It risks simplifying the narrative to justify sweeping changes without adequately considering potential negative impacts.

- ***Quote:** "Today, employee evaluation is back to pre-reform levels with almost all rated successful or above, frustrating any relation between pay and performance. An 'outstanding' rating should be required for Senior Executive Service (SES) chiefs to win big bonuses" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 65-66).*

    - **Summarize Quote:** Employee evaluations are inflated, and performance-based bonuses should be tied to truly outstanding ratings.

    - **Explanation:** This critique of inflated performance ratings points to the need for a more rigorous evaluation system. While performance-based incentives are important, the focus on outstanding ratings for bonuses might create pressure to meet arbitrary standards rather than foster genuine improvement. It could lead to competition and dissatisfaction among employees, undermining teamwork and morale.

### Conclusion

The subsection "Managing the Bureaucracy" from Project 2025 emphasizes a significant shift in how the federal workforce is managed, with a focus on centralizing control within the executive branch and prioritizing political alignment. The proposed changes raise several red flags regarding the potential erosion of the merit-based system and the impartiality of the civil service.

- **Centralization of Power**: The emphasis on the President's authority to appoint, direct, and remove personnel suggests a move towards centralizing control within the executive branch. While this is constitutionally grounded, it risks prioritizing loyalty over competence, potentially undermining the merit-based system designed to ensure that the most qualified individuals hold positions of power. This could lead to overreach and politicization of the civil service, compromising its neutrality and effectiveness.

- **Politicization of the Civil Service**: The proposed alignment of the civil service with the President's agenda and the suggestion to infiltrate political appointees into career positions indicate a shift towards a more politically driven workforce. This approach undermines the principle of an impartial and professional government workforce, leading to decisions based on political affiliations rather than merit or public interest.

- **Reclassification of Positions**: Executive Order 13957's aim to reclassify certain career positions under Schedule F, exempting them from competitive hiring rules, threatens the principles of a merit-based civil service. This reclassification could subject key positions to political influence, undermining the professionalism and independence of the civil service. The removal of competitive hiring safeguards poses a significant risk to the integrity and impartiality of government operations.

- **Critique of the Merit System**: The critique of the merit system for protecting underperforming employees and the call for more flexibility in hiring and firing processes suggest a desire to streamline personnel management. However, this could erode job security and fairness, leading to unjust dismissals and a demoralized workforce. Such changes might discourage public service careers, affecting the overall quality and stability of the civil service.

- **Historical References**: The historical references to calls for bureaucratic reform, such as those by Jimmy Carter, frame these reforms as essential for policy success. However, this narrative risks oversimplifying the complexities of governance and justifying sweeping changes without adequately considering potential negative impacts on fairness, efficiency, and public trust.

- **Performance-Based Incentives**: The critique of inflated performance ratings and the proposal to tie bonuses to outstanding ratings suggest a need for more rigorous evaluation systems. While performance-based incentives are important, the focus on outstanding ratings could create pressure to meet arbitrary standards, potentially fostering competition and dissatisfaction among employees, undermining teamwork and morale.

### Conclusion Statement
The proposed changes in "Managing the Bureaucracy" aim to enhance efficiency and ensure alignment with the President's agenda. However, these reforms raise significant concerns about the potential for politicization, overreach, and the erosion of the merit-based civil service system. The implications of the immunity ruling could amplify these changes, allowing for even greater centralization of power and reduced accountability. This could lead to a significant shift in how the federal bureaucracy operates, prioritizing political loyalty over competence and undermining the principles of fair and impartial government service. The long-term impact could be a less effective and less trusted civil service, with far-reaching consequences for governance and public trust in government institutions.

## <span id="nutshell">"Central Personnel Agencies: Managing the Bureaucracy" In a Nutshell</span>

This section of Project 2025, titled "Central Personnel Agencies: Managing the Bureaucracy," emphasizes the importance of personnel management within the federal government, adhering to the philosophy that "personnel is policy." The section discusses the roles of key personnel agencies, such as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), in managing the federal workforce. It also identifies various challenges within the current system and proposes reforms aimed at making the federal workforce more accountable, efficient, and aligned with the President's agenda.

A primary concern is the potential reintroduction of Schedule F, which would allow for easier hiring and firing of federal employees based on political considerations. This proposal threatens the merit-based principles that have traditionally governed federal employment, potentially leading to a workforce that is more politicized and less capable of providing impartial advice.

The section also critiques the difficulty in removing underperforming federal employees due to complex appeals processes and overly protective personnel policies. While accountability is important, the suggested reforms could lead to a system where employees are removed without due process, potentially resulting in unfair dismissals and a demoralized workforce.

Additionally, the section advocates for performance appraisals and merit pay, suggesting that current performance evaluations are overly generous and disconnected from actual job performance. While tying pay and promotions to performance could incentivize better work, there is a risk that such systems could be manipulated in a politicized environment, leading to favoritism and discrimination.

The impact of public-sector unions is also addressed, with the document suggesting that union influence should be curtailed to improve government efficiency. However, weakening unions could reduce employee protections and lead to a more vulnerable workforce.

Overall, the proposals in this section raise significant concerns about the potential politicization of the federal workforce, the erosion of merit-based hiring and promotion practices, and the weakening of employee protections. The focus on aligning the federal workforce with the President's agenda risks creating a less effective and more partisan bureaucracy, undermining the principles of impartiality and professionalism that are essential to good governance.
