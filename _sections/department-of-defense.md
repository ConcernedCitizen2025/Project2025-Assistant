# "Department of Defense" *Between the Lines*

**Summary:**
Section 2.4 of Project 2025, titled "Department of Defense," outlines a vision for reforming and strengthening the U.S. military to better address modern threats, with a particular focus on China. The section emphasizes the need for a more robust and agile military capable of facing the complexities of great-power competition. It highlights the importance of modernizing nuclear capabilities, increasing defense spending, and ensuring that the military remains focused on warfighting rather than social issues.

**In-Depth Analysis:**

1. **Prioritizing Defense Against China:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The document identifies China as the primary threat to U.S. national security and advocates for a defense strategy centered on countering Chinese military expansion, particularly in relation to Taiwan and other U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific region.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While focusing on China is strategically important, the aggressive posture recommended could escalate tensions and potentially lead to military conflict. The emphasis on denial defense, particularly in Taiwan, suggests a willingness to engage in high-risk scenarios that could draw the U.S. into a prolonged conflict with a nuclear-armed power.
   - **Potential Consequences:** An overemphasis on military solutions to the China threat could overshadow diplomatic efforts, increasing the likelihood of miscalculation and conflict. Additionally, prioritizing resources for this focus might neglect other critical areas of defense and foreign policy.

2. **Transforming Military Culture:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The section advocates for removing what it describes as a "two-tiered culture of accountability" and eliminating policies seen as politicizing the military, such as equity initiatives and vaccine mandates. It calls for a return to a warfighting focus, free from social engineering.
   - **Concerning Implications:** This stance risks alienating service members who value inclusivity and equity within the military. It could also reverse progress made in creating a more diverse and representative armed force. The language used suggests a sharp division between traditional military values and modern social policies, potentially leading to a less cohesive military.
   - **Potential Consequences:** The proposed cultural shift could result in a military that is less reflective of the nation it serves, potentially reducing morale and effectiveness. It could also discourage recruitment from diverse segments of the population, weakening the overall strength of the armed forces.

3. **Modernizing Nuclear Capabilities:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The document calls for the modernization and expansion of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, emphasizing the need to match or exceed the capabilities of Russia and China. This includes developing new nuclear weapons and ensuring the U.S. is not vulnerable to nuclear coercion.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent is crucial, the push for significant expansion could contribute to a new arms race, increasing global instability. The focus on nuclear weapons might also divert resources from other critical areas of defense and create a reliance on nuclear solutions to geopolitical challenges.
   - **Potential Consequences:** Expanding the nuclear arsenal could lead to increased tensions with other nuclear powers and undermine international arms control agreements. It may also provoke other nations to enhance their nuclear capabilities, leading to greater global insecurity.

4. **Increasing Allied Burden-Sharing:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The section advocates for greater responsibility-sharing among U.S. allies, particularly in Europe and Asia. It suggests that allies take a more active role in their defense, allowing the U.S. to focus its resources more strategically.
   - **Concerning Implications:** While encouraging allies to take on more defense responsibilities is a reasonable approach, it could lead to a reduction in U.S. influence in key regions. If not managed carefully, it might also embolden adversaries who perceive a weakening of U.S. commitments to global security.
   - **Potential Consequences:** A shift towards greater allied burden-sharing could strain relationships with traditional allies, particularly if they feel pressured to increase their defense spending or take on more military responsibilities without adequate support from the U.S.

5. **Defense Industrial Base Strengthening:**
   - **Policy Proposal:** The document calls for strengthening the U.S. defense industrial base, including replenishing stockpiles depleted by aid to Ukraine and encouraging domestic manufacturing of defense materials.
   - **Concerning Implications:** Strengthening the defense industrial base is essential for national security, but focusing too heavily on rearmament could lead to economic distortions and prioritize military spending over other critical areas of the economy.
   - **Potential Consequences:** While bolstering the defense industrial base can enhance military readiness, there is a risk of entrenching the military-industrial complex, potentially leading to excessive defense spending at the expense of social and economic programs.

**Conclusion Statement:**
The proposals in the "Department of Defense" section of Project 2025 outline a vision for a more aggressive and focused military, particularly in response to the perceived threat from China. While many of the recommendations aim to strengthen U.S. defense capabilities, they also raise significant concerns about the potential for increased militarization, the erosion of inclusivity within the military, and the risks of escalating tensions with other global powers. As these policies are considered, it is essential to ensure they promote a balanced approach to national security that includes both military and diplomatic efforts.

## Potential Concerns: Department of Defense

### Increased Defense Spending

The call for increased defense spending, while aimed at ensuring military readiness and modernization, poses significant budgetary challenges. Allocating substantial funds to defense could divert resources from other critical areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Balancing the defense budget with other national priorities is crucial to prevent negative impacts on the overall well-being of society.

### Ethical and Legal Implications of Emerging Technologies

The focus on developing and deploying advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and cyber capabilities raises ethical and legal issues. These technologies, if not properly regulated, could lead to unintended consequences, including violations of international law and human rights. The lack of clear regulations and international agreements governing the use of these technologies in warfare is a significant concern.

### Militarization of Space

The emphasis on enhancing space defense capabilities could contribute to the militarization of space. This raises the risk of an arms race in space, potentially destabilizing global security. Diplomatic efforts to establish international norms and treaties for the peaceful use of space are crucial to prevent the escalation of space-based conflicts.

### Potential for Politicization in Personnel Management

While improving personnel management is essential, there is a risk that streamlining the recruitment process and focusing on competitive compensation could lead to politicization. Ensuring that the recruitment and retention of military personnel are based on merit and inclusivity, rather than political considerations, is vital to maintain a fair and effective workforce.

### Impact on Civil Liberties and Human Rights

Enhanced intelligence-gathering capabilities and information warfare strategies must be implemented with strict adherence to ethical guidelines and respect for civil liberties and human rights. There is a risk that these measures could be misused, leading to violations of privacy, freedom of expression, and other fundamental rights.

### Resource Allocation and Efficiency

The proposed increase in defense spending and resource allocation must be accompanied by rigorous oversight to ensure efficiency and prevent waste. The potential for misallocation of funds and bureaucratic inefficiencies is a significant concern. Establishing robust oversight mechanisms and conducting regular audits are essential to maintain accountability.

### Dependence on International Alliances

While strengthening international alliances is beneficial for collective security, overreliance on these partnerships could pose risks. Changes in the geopolitical landscape or shifts in the foreign policies of allied nations could affect the stability and effectiveness of these alliances. The U.S. must maintain a balance between fostering strong partnerships and ensuring its own strategic autonomy.

### Transparency and Accountability

Ensuring transparency and accountability in the implementation of the proposed reforms is crucial. The establishment of oversight mechanisms is a positive step, but these mechanisms must be genuinely independent and empowered to hold all levels of the Department of Defense accountable. There is a risk that without proper oversight, the reforms could lead to abuses of power and a lack of accountability.

### Impact on Military Families

While the plan emphasizes improvements in quality of life for service members, it is essential to consider the broader impact on military families. Issues such as mental health support, educational opportunities for children, and spousal employment need to be addressed comprehensively to ensure the well-being of military families. Failure to do so could affect morale and retention rates.

### Conclusion

The "Department of Defense" subsection of Project 2025 presents a detailed plan to enhance U.S. defense capabilities, but it also raises several significant concerns. Addressing the ethical and legal implications of emerging technologies, preventing the militarization of space, ensuring fair and inclusive personnel management, and maintaining transparency and accountability are critical challenges that need careful consideration. Balancing increased defense spending with other national priorities and fostering international alliances without compromising strategic autonomy are essential for the successful implementation of the proposed reforms.

## Breaking Down the Concerns: Department of Defense

- **Increased Defense Spending**: The plan calls for more money to be spent on defense, but this could mean less money for things like schools, healthcare, and infrastructure. It's important to make sure the budget is balanced so other important areas don't suffer.

- **Emerging Technologies**: Using advanced tech like AI and drones in warfare raises ethical and legal questions. Without clear rules, these technologies might be misused, leading to violations of international laws and human rights.

- **Militarization of Space**: Focusing on space defense could lead to an arms race in space, making global security more unstable. It's important to have international agreements to keep space peaceful.

- **Personnel Management**: Improving how military staff are managed is good, but there's a risk of hiring based on politics instead of merit. Ensuring fair and inclusive hiring practices is crucial.

- **Civil Liberties**: Enhancing intelligence and information warfare must respect privacy and human rights. There is a risk that these measures could infringe on personal freedoms if not handled carefully.

- **Resource Allocation**: Increasing defense spending needs careful monitoring to avoid waste. Ensuring funds are used efficiently and transparently is essential to prevent mismanagement.

- **Dependence on Alliances**: Building strong international alliances is beneficial, but relying too much on them could be risky. Changing geopolitical situations could affect these partnerships, so the U.S. needs to maintain some independence.

- **Transparency and Accountability**: Ensuring the proposed changes are transparent and accountable is crucial. Oversight mechanisms need to be strong and independent to prevent abuse of power.

- **Impact on Military Families**: While the plan aims to improve life for service members, it's also important to consider the needs of their families. Issues like mental health support, education, and employment opportunities for spouses need attention to maintain morale and retention.

## <span id="redflags">Red Flags in the Reforms: Analyzing Troubling Quotes</span>

- ***Quote:** "The DOD is also a deeply troubled institution. Historically, the military has been one of America’s most trusted institutions, but years of sustained misuse, a two-tiered culture of accountability that shields senior officers and officials while exposing junior officers and soldiers in the field, wasteful spending, wildly shifting security policies, exceedingly poor discipline in program execution, and (most recently) the Biden Administration’s profoundly unserious equity agenda and vaccine mandates have taken a serious toll" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 84).*
  
    - **Summarize Quote:** The Department of Defense has faced issues like misuse, lack of accountability for senior officials, wasteful spending, and poor execution, worsened by the Biden administration's policies.  

    - **Explanation:** This quote criticizes the current state of the DOD, emphasizing issues such as lack of accountability and wasteful spending. The mention of "profoundly unserious equity agenda and vaccine mandates" indicates a dismissal of efforts to address diversity and public health, which are critical for maintaining a healthy and inclusive military force. The critique implies a resistance to policies that aim to protect and respect the well-being of military personnel, potentially leading to a less inclusive and equitable environment. This perspective might downplay the importance of equity and public health measures, which could undermine morale and the effectiveness of the military.

- ***Quote:** "More important is how new technologies are developed, tested, procured, and used, and that relies on the true competitive advantages of our people: ingenuity, common sense, and thoughtfulness grounded in a free society" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 84-85).*  
  
    - **Summarize Quote:** The focus should be on how new technologies are developed and used, relying on the people's ingenuity and common sense.  

    - **Explanation:** This statement emphasizes a reliance on the general population's "ingenuity, common sense, and thoughtfulness" for technological development, potentially minimizing the importance of structured, expert-led research and development processes. While valuing public input and innovation is important, overly relying on these aspects without adequate oversight and expertise can lead to suboptimal decision-making. This approach might also ignore the need for rigorous testing and evaluation, which are crucial for ensuring that new technologies are safe and effective for military use.

- ***Quote:** "Priority No. 3: Provide necessary support to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) border protection operations. Border protection is a national security issue that requires sustained attention and effort by all elements of the executive branch" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 85).*  
 
    - **Summarize Quote:** Supporting DHS in border protection is a key national security issue requiring attention from the executive branch.  

    - **Explanation:** While border security is a legitimate concern, the emphasis on treating it as a major national security issue could lead to the militarization of immigration enforcement. This approach risks conflating national security threats with immigration issues, potentially justifying excessive use of force or surveillance against migrants. Such policies can lead to human rights violations and a lack of compassion towards vulnerable populations, including asylum seekers and refugees. The implication that all elements of the executive branch should be involved in this effort could also blur the lines between civilian law enforcement and military operations, raising constitutional concerns about the use of military forces in domestic matters.

- ***Quote:** "Prioritize enhancing the capability of allies and partners to take the lead in combating terrorism in their regions" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 88).*  
  
    - **Summarize Quote:** The U.S. should help allies and partners enhance their ability to combat terrorism locally.  

    - **Explanation:** This quote suggests a shift towards empowering other nations to take the lead in counter-terrorism efforts. While building local capacity is positive, it can also be problematic if it results in the U.S. supporting governments or groups with poor human rights records. This approach could inadvertently endorse or enable abusive practices, leading to further instability and potential backlash against the U.S. Furthermore, relying heavily on local forces without adequate oversight and support could lead to inconsistent and potentially ineffective counter-terrorism strategies.

- ***Quote:** "The most significant danger to Americans’ security, freedoms, and prosperity is China" (Project 2025, 2024, p. 85).*  
 
    - **Summarize Quote:** China is seen as the greatest threat to U.S. security, freedoms, and prosperity.  

    - **Explanation:** Identifying China as the primary threat suggests a focus on a confrontational approach in U.S.-China relations. While addressing national security concerns is vital, framing China as the most significant danger risks escalating tensions and fostering an adversarial atmosphere that could lead to conflict. Such a stance might also justify increased military spending and aggressive foreign policies, potentially neglecting diplomatic solutions. It is essential to balance security concerns with efforts to maintain peaceful and constructive international relations.

**Conclusion:**  
The Department of Defense section in Project 2025 reflects a perspective that prioritizes traditional military strength and a confrontational stance towards perceived threats, particularly China. The emphasis on reducing bureaucratic oversight and relying on local ingenuity for technological advancements suggests a shift away from structured, expert-led processes. The critique of the Biden administration's policies indicates a resistance to measures aimed at promoting equity and public health within the military. Furthermore, the focus on border protection and supporting local counter-terrorism efforts may raise concerns about human rights and the appropriate role of the military in domestic affairs. Combined with the implications of the immunity ruling, these policies could lead to unchecked executive power in military and national security matters, potentially undermining democratic oversight and accountability.

## <span id="nutshell">"Department of Defense" in a Nutshell</span>

The "Department of Defense" section of Project 2025 proposes a comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. military, with a strong emphasis on countering China's growing influence.
