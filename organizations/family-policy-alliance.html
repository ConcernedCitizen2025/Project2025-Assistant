        <h1 id="family-policy-alliance-fpa">Family Policy Alliance (FPA)</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Family Policy Alliance (FPA) is a conservative Christian advocacy organization founded as CitizenLink, a public policy affiliate of Focus on the Family. Headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, FPA aims to advance biblical citizenship and promote policies that align with Christian values. The organization focuses on issues such as the sanctity of life, religious freedom, parental rights, and education. FPA is also active in training Christian leaders to influence public policy and has a strong grassroots presence across the United States.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>FPA’s mission is to advance Christian values in public policy through education, advocacy, and engagement. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Policy Advocacy:</strong> FPA engages in policy advocacy at both state and national levels, working to influence legislation on issues such as abortion, religious liberty, and education choice. The organization also supports stringent election laws, which it argues are necessary to protect voter integrity.</li>
  <li><strong>Educational Programs:</strong> FPA runs several programs, including the Statesmen Academy, which trains Christian leaders to influence public policy from a faith-based perspective. The School Board Academy is another initiative focused on preparing Christians to serve on school boards and advocate for conservative education policies.</li>
  <li><strong>Publications and Media:</strong> FPA produces various publications, articles, and reports that address key issues from a conservative Christian viewpoint, aiming to inform and mobilize their supporters.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_DeRoche">Craig DeRoche</a>:</strong> President and CEO of FPA, DeRoche has a background in public policy and advocacy, focusing on promoting Christian values in the public square. His leadership has expanded FPA’s influence in national and state-level policy debates, particularly those concerning religious freedom and family values.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/meridian-baldacci">Meridian Baldacci</a>:</strong> Director of Strategy and Messaging, Baldacci oversees the organization’s communication strategies and public engagement. Her role is crucial in shaping the public discourse around FPA’s core issues.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2024/08/22/hate-group-urged-georgia-governor-ban-trans-kids-school-sports">Cole Muzio</a>:</strong> Executive Director of Frontline Policy Council (formerly FPA of Georgia), Muzio is known for his advocacy efforts in Georgia, particularly in promoting election laws that favor conservative Christian voters. His leadership reflects FPA’s broader agenda of influencing state policies in line with its values.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>FPA has supported and aligned with the Trump administration, particularly on issues like religious liberty and anti-abortion policies. The organization is also involved in Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative aimed at shaping conservative policy for future Republican administrations.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Voter Suppression Allegations:</strong> FPA’s advocacy for stringent election laws has been criticized as promoting voter suppression, particularly aimed at minority and liberal demographics. Critics argue that these efforts may undermine the democratic process.</li>
  <li><strong>Anti-LGBTQ Stance:</strong> FPA’s strong opposition to LGBTQ rights, including efforts to block transgender rights and same-sex marriage, has led to criticism and designation as an anti-LGBTQ group by organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center. These positions have sparked significant debate and controversy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Family Policy Alliance is a prominent player in the conservative Christian advocacy landscape, promoting policies that align with biblical values. While it has significant influence on public policy, its controversial positions on issues like LGBTQ rights and election laws highlight the need for ongoing scrutiny and balanced public discourse.</p>
