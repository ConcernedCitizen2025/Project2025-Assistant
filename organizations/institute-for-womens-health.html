        <h1 id="institute-for-womens-health-iwh">Institute for Women’s Health (IWH)</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Institute for Women’s Health (IWH) is a nonprofit organization headquartered in Washington, D.C., focused on promoting optimal health for women across all stages of life. Founded in 2021 by Valerie Huber, IWH engages in both domestic and international initiatives to build coalitions that support women’s health by addressing critical health issues. The organization is particularly noted for its advocacy of pro-family and pro-life policies on a global scale, often working closely with conservative governments and organizations.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>IWH’s mission is to advocate for the health and well-being of women globally by removing barriers to healthcare access and fostering collaboration among governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Coalition Building:</strong> IWH collaborates with various partners, including governments and NGOs, to enhance women’s access to healthcare. The organization plays a significant role in promoting the Geneva Consensus Declaration (GCD), which aligns with its pro-life and pro-family values.</li>
  <li><strong>Educational Outreach:</strong> The organization provides resources and information to educate the public and policymakers about women’s health issues, with a focus on promoting health practices that align with its values.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy Advocacy:</strong> IWH works to influence health policies that support women’s health, often aligning with conservative health policy initiatives and opposing policies that conflict with its pro-life stance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Valerie Huber, M.Ed.:</strong> Founder and President of IWH, Huber has an extensive background in global women’s health. She previously served as Special Representative for Global Women’s Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) during the Trump administration, where she played a key role in promoting the Geneva Consensus Declaration.</li>
  <li><strong>Dr. Alma Golden:</strong> Chief Operating Officer (COO). Dr. Golden has a rich background in healthcare policy, having served as the Assistant Administrator for the Bureau for Global Health at USAID. Her work at IWH focuses on improving health outcomes for women globally.</li>
  <li><strong>Victoria Akyea, M.P.H.:</strong> Executive Management Director. Akyea manages IWH’s operations and contributes to its strategic initiatives, drawing on her experience in public health.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>IWH has strong connections to the Trump administration, particularly through Valerie Huber’s and Dr. Alma Golden’s previous roles in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These connections reflect IWH’s alignment with conservative health policy initiatives, especially those related to women’s health and reproductive issues, as promoted during Trump’s presidency.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Potential Political Bias:</strong> IWH’s strong ties to conservative figures and its focus on pro-family and pro-life issues have raised concerns about potential biases in its advocacy and policy recommendations. Critics argue that these positions could limit the organization’s inclusivity and objectivity in addressing broader women’s health issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Institute for Women’s Health is a significant player in promoting women’s health through coalition-building, policy advocacy, and educational outreach. Its strong leadership and connections to conservative health policy initiatives highlight its influence in global health discussions. However, the potential for political bias necessitates careful examination of its advocacy efforts and policy recommendations.</p>
