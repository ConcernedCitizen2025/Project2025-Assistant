<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>First Liberty Institute is a prominent conservative legal organization headquartered in Plano, Texas. It specializes in defending religious freedom across the United States. Founded in 1997 by Kelly Shackelford, the institute has grown into the nation’s largest legal organization exclusively dedicated to protecting religious liberties. The institute provides pro bono legal representation to individuals and organizations facing religious liberty challenges, often taking cases to the U.S. Supreme Court to set important legal precedents.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>First Liberty Institute’s mission is to defend and restore religious liberty in America. The organization’s key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Legal Defense:</strong> Offering free legal services in cases involving religious liberty, with several high-profile lawsuits reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Education:</strong> Engaging in public education through producing materials, hosting events, and conducting media outreach to raise awareness about issues related to religious freedom.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy Advocacy:</strong> Participating in policy discussions and advocating for laws that protect religious freedoms at both the state and federal levels.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://fedsoc.org/contributors/kelly-shackelford">Kelly Shackelford</a>:</strong> Founder, President, CEO, and Chief Counsel. Shackelford is a constitutional scholar with a significant impact on religious liberty jurisprudence in the U.S. He has argued and won numerous landmark cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and is a prominent figure in the conservative legal community.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://fedsoc.org/contributors/jeffrey-mateer">Jeff Mateer</a>:</strong> Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. Mateer has extensive experience in both public and private legal practice, particularly in cases involving religious liberty and civil rights. He rejoined First Liberty after serving as the First Assistant Attorney General of Texas.</li>
  <li><strong>David Holmes:</strong> Executive Vice President and Chief Operating/Financial Officer. Holmes oversees all operational aspects of First Liberty, including finance and development. His background includes experience in finance and military service.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>First Liberty Institute has notable connections to the Trump administration. Key figures within the organization, such as Ken Klukowski and Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, held significant roles during Trump’s presidency. Klukowski was involved in Trump’s presidential transition team and later served as Senior Counsel at the Department of Justice. Kacsmaryk, who previously served as Deputy General Counsel at First Liberty, was nominated by Trump and confirmed as a federal judge in 2019. These connections underscore the institute’s influence within the Trump administration and its alignment with conservative judicial appointments.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Controversial Stances:</strong> First Liberty has been involved in several high-profile cases that have sparked debates about the boundaries of religious freedom and the separation of church and state.</li>
  <li><strong>Potential Bias:</strong> The organization’s close ties to conservative political figures and involvement in politically charged cases raise concerns about potential partisan bias in its advocacy efforts. This could lead to questions regarding the impartiality of its legal work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>First Liberty Institute plays a critical role in defending religious freedom in the United States, with significant legal victories that have shaped First Amendment rights. However, its controversial stances and strong connections to conservative politics suggest that its activities should be scrutinized to ensure they are genuinely focused on protecting religious liberty rather than advancing a partisan agenda.</p>
