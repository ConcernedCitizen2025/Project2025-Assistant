<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Concerned Women for America (CWA) is a socially conservative evangelical Christian non-profit organization founded in 1978 by Beverly LaHaye. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., CWA is one of the largest public policy women’s organizations in the United States, focusing on promoting Biblical values and Constitutional principles through prayer, education, and advocacy. The organization is heavily involved in social and political movements, advocating on issues such as the sanctity of life, defense of family, religious liberty, education, national sovereignty, and support for Israel.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>CWA’s mission is to impact the culture for Christ through public policy. Key activities include representing conservative Christian values on Capitol Hill, running programs like Young Women for America (YWA) to train and equip the next generation of Christian conservative women, and publishing articles and reports to influence public opinion from a Christian conservative perspective.</p>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Penny Young Nance:</strong> CEO and President of CWA, Nance has led the organization since 2010, expanding its influence in conservative policy circles. She is also a senior advisor at the Christian Post and a frequent media commentator.</li>
  <li><strong>Timothy LaHaye:</strong> Co-founder and husband of Beverly LaHaye, Timothy was an evangelical Christian minister and author who played a significant role in shaping the organization’s focus on traditional Christian values.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>CWA has supported and aligned with the Trump administration, particularly in areas like religious liberty and anti-abortion policies. Penny Nance served on Trump’s Life Advisory Council and frequently represented Christian conservative women at the White House, amplifying the organization’s influence within the Republican Party.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<p>CWA has been criticized for its extreme right-wing bias and was designated as an anti-LGBTQ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center due to its stance on LGBTQ rights and other social issues. This designation highlights ongoing concerns about the organization’s impact on civil rights and inclusivity.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Concerned Women for America is a prominent conservative organization dedicated to promoting Biblical values in public policy. While it has a significant following and influence, its controversial stances on LGBTQ rights and alignment with extreme right-wing ideologies highlight the need for critical examination of its activities and advocacy efforts.</p>
