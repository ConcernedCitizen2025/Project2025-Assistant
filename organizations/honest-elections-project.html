        <h1 id="honest-elections-project-hep">Honest Elections Project (HEP)</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Honest Elections Project (HEP) is a conservative advocacy group established in 2020, focusing on ensuring electoral integrity through public engagement, advocacy, and public-interest litigation. Operating under The 85 Fund, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, HEP promotes what it considers to be fair and common-sense measures to protect the integrity of the voting process.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>HEP’s mission is to support the right of every lawful voter to participate in free and honest elections. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Election Reform Advocacy:</strong> HEP promotes policies aimed at securing the voting process, safeguarding absentee ballots, and maintaining accurate voter rolls. The organization advocates for voter ID requirements, pre- and post-election audits, and stringent mail-in voting regulations.</li>
  <li><strong>Public-Interest Litigation:</strong> HEP engages in legal battles to uphold election laws and challenge changes to voting procedures that it views as unlawful or prone to fraud.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Engagement:</strong> HEP conducts surveys and educational campaigns to inform and mobilize public opinion in favor of election integrity measures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/jason-snead">Jason Snead</a>:</strong> Executive Director, formerly a senior policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation. Snead managed the development of the Heritage Election Fraud Database and is a strong advocate for voter ID laws and other stringent voting regulations.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Campbell_Severino">Carrie Severino</a>:</strong> Connected to The 85 Fund, Severino has been a key figure in conservative legal movements, particularly through her work with the Judicial Crisis Network. She has significant influence within HEP’s parent organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>HEP has notable connections to the Trump administration, particularly through its advocacy for policies that were prominent during Trump’s presidency, such as voter ID laws and opposition to mail-in voting expansions. The organization has aligned closely with the rhetoric and legal strategies employed by Trump and his affiliates regarding electoral integrity.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Bias and Controversy:</strong> HEP has faced criticism for promoting policies that some argue could suppress voter turnout among minority and low-income populations. The organization’s advocacy against mail-in voting and its push for voter roll purges have sparked concerns about potential disenfranchisement.</li>
  <li><strong>Involvement with Dark Money Networks:</strong> HEP operates under The 85 Fund, which is part of a broader network of conservative organizations linked to significant anonymous funding. This has raised concerns about transparency and the influence of dark money in its operations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Honest Elections Project is a significant player in the conservative movement to reform election laws and ensure voting integrity. While its efforts align with the broader agenda of the Trump administration, its controversial stances and the potential impacts on voter accessibility highlight the need for careful scrutiny of its advocacy and policy proposals.</p>
