<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>American Compass is a conservative think tank founded by Oren Cass in 2020 with the aim of reshaping the conservative economic agenda to prioritize family, community, and industry. The organization challenges the traditional free-market orthodoxy within conservative circles, advocating for policies that support American workers and industries while addressing the shortcomings of globalization and financialization. American Compass has quickly positioned itself as a key player in the debate over the future direction of conservative economic policy, particularly as the Republican Party reconsiders its economic priorities in a post-Trump era.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>American Compass works to develop a conservative economic agenda that integrates traditional values with modern policy challenges. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Research and Publications:</strong> The organization produces reports, essays, and policy papers critiquing contemporary economic policies and proposing alternatives. Their work addresses issues such as globalization, industrial policy, and labor rights. Notably, American Compass has been influential in shifting conservative economic discussions toward a more worker-centric approach.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Engagement:</strong> American Compass hosts events, podcasts, and debates to discuss economic issues and conservative principles. The organization frequently engages with conservative media and policymakers to influence public discourse and policy, positioning itself as a thought leader in the emerging populist wing of the conservative movement.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy Proposals:</strong> American Compass advocates for policies that constrain speculative financial practices, support non-college career pathways, and promote family stability and community resilience. These proposals are designed to create a more balanced and sustainable economic system that serves all Americans.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oren_Cass">Oren Cass</a>:</strong> Founder and Executive Director of American Compass, Cass is a prominent conservative policy analyst known for his critiques of neoliberal economic policies and advocacy for a worker-centric economic approach. He has been a significant voice in the post-Trump conservative realignment, arguing for a more populist and nationalist approach to economic policy. Under his leadership, American Compass has gained attention for challenging the GOP’s traditional economic stances and advocating for reforms that prioritize the interests of American workers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>American Compass has connections to broader conservative movements, including affiliations with figures from the Trump administration. While Cass has critiqued certain aspects of Trump’s policies, particularly their execution, he acknowledges that Trump’s presidency marked a significant shift in the Republican Party’s economic priorities. The organization’s focus on reshaping economic policies and addressing the failures of globalization aligns with themes popularized during the Trump era, such as economic nationalism and skepticism of free trade. Moreover, American Compass has cultivated relationships with key Trump allies, including Senators JD Vance and Marco Rubio, who have supported its policy proposals.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Potential Bias:</strong> The organization’s strong conservative stance and departure from traditional free-market principles have sparked debates within conservative circles about the implications of its critiques. Some critics argue that American Compass’s policy proposals, which often call for significant government intervention, could undermine long-standing conservative economic principles.</li>
  <li><strong>Controversial Positions:</strong> American Compass’s critiques of free-market policies and globalization have made it a focal point for discussions about the future of conservative economic policy. Its proposals for increased government intervention in the economy, such as aggressive antitrust enforcement and financial transaction taxes, have been met with resistance from traditional conservative economists who view these measures as antithetical to free-market principles.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>American Compass is a significant voice in the conservative economic policy debate, advocating for reforms that prioritize workers, families, and national industry. Its focus on rethinking traditional economic policies and promoting conservative values positions it as a key player in shaping the future of conservative economic agendas. However, its strong ideological orientation and willingness to break from traditional conservative economic orthodoxy necessitate careful consideration of its recommendations and potential biases.</p>
