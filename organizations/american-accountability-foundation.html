        <h1 id="american-accountability-foundation">American Accountability Foundation</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The American Accountability Foundation (AAF) is a conservative nonprofit organization founded in 2020, focused on government oversight and research. AAF aims to promote transparency and accountability within the federal government, often targeting the Biden administration through aggressive opposition research, ethics complaints, and public campaigns. The organization has played a significant role in challenging Biden administration nominees, including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and FCC nominee Gigi Sohn.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>AAF’s mission is to educate the public on government personnel, policy, and spending through investigative research and public advocacy. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Investigative Research:</strong> AAF conducts in-depth investigations into government officials, particularly those perceived as opposing conservative values. The organization uses this research to influence public opinion and legislative decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Advocacy:</strong> AAF publishes reports, white papers, and press releases aimed at informing the public and policymakers about its findings. The foundation actively works to shape public opinion and influence policy decisions through assertive campaigns.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Sovereignty 2025:</strong> This initiative focuses on identifying high-ranking civil servants within the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Justice (DOJ) who might obstruct a conservative administration’s agenda, particularly regarding immigration. This project aligns with the broader Project 2025 initiative supported by the Heritage Foundation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/24/american-accountability-foundation-creates-list-of/">Tom Jones</a>:</strong> Founder and President of AAF, Jones has a background in political policy and research, including roles such as Legislative Director for Senator Ron Johnson and opposition research for Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. He is known for his aggressive tactics and deep connections within the conservative movement.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.monitoringinfluence.org/org/american-accountability-foundation/">Jerome Trankle</a>:</strong> Research Director, Trankle has experience with the Cannon Research Group and has worked closely with conservative figures like Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Andy Barr, focusing on gathering and analyzing opposition research.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>AAF is connected to the Trump administration through its advisory role in Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative designed to shape conservative policy for future Republican administrations. The organization’s efforts to oppose Biden administration nominees and policies closely align with the broader goals of the conservative movement, reflecting its deep ties to Trump-era politics. AAF’s Project Sovereignty 2025 specifically targets federal employees who are seen as potential obstacles to a conservative agenda, echoing strategies associated with Trump’s Schedule F policy.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Bias:</strong> AAF’s strong conservative stance and aggressive tactics in opposing Biden administration nominees and policies have led to criticisms of bias. The organization’s methods, including filing ethics complaints and releasing opposition research, have been characterized as unethical by some critics, raising questions about the fairness and integrity of its operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Controversial Tactics:</strong> AAF has been involved in various high-profile campaigns that have drawn criticism for their aggressive nature. This includes its role in derailing the nomination of Gigi Sohn to the FCC, a campaign that was heavily funded by dark money and characterized by misleading and partisan attacks. AAF has also faced scrutiny for its lack of transparency in political spending, with reports indicating that it may not have fully disclosed its advertising expenditures, potentially complicating its tax-exempt status.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The American Accountability Foundation plays a significant role in conservative political advocacy, focusing on government oversight and transparency. Its strong ideological stance and connections to conservative movements underscore its influence but also warrant careful consideration of its methods and potential biases. The organization’s involvement in Project 2025 and its aggressive campaigns against Biden nominees highlight its significant impact on the current political landscape.</p>
