<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies (DFI) is a conservative think tank founded in 2021 by Robert S. Eitel and Jim Blew, both of whom served under Secretary Betsy DeVos in the U.S. Department of Education during the Trump administration. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., DFI aims to advance freedom and opportunity for American families, students, entrepreneurs, and workers by protecting civil and constitutional rights in education and employment. The organization is known for its strong stance against federal government overreach in these areas, advocating instead for increased school choice and reduced regulatory burdens.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>DFI focuses on providing conservative solutions to challenges in education, workforce, labor, and employment. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Policy Advocacy:</strong> Promoting policies that limit federal involvement in education and increase school choice options, such as charter schools, private schools, and homeschooling. DFI also supports deregulation in labor markets to enhance workforce flexibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal and Strategic Advocacy:</strong> Engaging in litigation and regulatory oversight to challenge what it views as federal overreach, particularly in the areas of education and labor. DFI actively participates in court cases and submits amicus briefs on issues related to educational freedom and labor rights.</li>
  <li><strong>Publications and Research:</strong> Producing reports, policy briefs, and public comments on federal policies. DFI also holds events like the Education Law &amp; Policy Conference to discuss and shape federal legal and policy issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="/contributors/robert-s-eitel.html">Robert S. Eitel</a>:</strong> Co-founder and President of DFI, Eitel has extensive experience in education and employment law. He served as Senior Counselor to the Secretary of Education and Regulatory Reform Officer at the U.S. Department of Education, where he played a key role in shaping policy reforms under Secretary DeVos.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="/contributors/jim-blew.html">Jim Blew</a>:</strong> Co-founder and Vice President of DFI, Blew has over two decades of experience in education reform, including senior roles at the Walton Family Foundation and as Assistant Secretary for Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development at the U.S. Department of Education.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>DFI’s founders and key leaders have strong ties to the Trump administration, particularly through their roles in the Department of Education. The institute’s agenda of reducing federal oversight and expanding school choice aligns closely with the policies pursued by the Trump administration. Additionally, DFI has received significant financial support from foundations associated with key conservative figures, including the DeVos family.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Opposition to Federal Oversight:</strong> DFI’s strong stance against federal involvement in education and labor raises concerns about the potential for reduced accountability and oversight, which could negatively affect the quality and equity of education and employment practices in the U.S.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Defense of Freedom Institute plays a significant role in shaping conservative policy in education and labor. Its advocacy for reduced federal intervention and increased school choice reflects its commitment to libertarian principles. However, the potential implications of its policy recommendations, particularly regarding accountability and equity, warrant careful scrutiny.</p>
