<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Founder and Chairman of the American Cornerstone Institute, previously served as the 17th Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Dr. Ben Carson is a renowned neurosurgeon, having served as Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center for nearly 30 years. He performed the first successful separation of twins conjoined at the back of the head. He attended Yale University and earned his MD from the University of Michigan Medical School. Dr. Carson has authored numerous books and received numerous awards for his contributions to medicine and education.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Dr. Carson served as the 17th United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from 2017 to 2021. Initially a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, he endorsed Trump after dropping out of the race. During his tenure at HUD, Carson’s policies closely aligned with Trump’s agenda on housing and urban development. His involvement in Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative with strong ties to former Trump officials, further connects him to Trump’s political sphere.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
During his time as HUD Secretary, Carson faced scrutiny for various issues, including the agency’s purchase of expensive office furniture and his management style. Despite these controversies, no significant legal or ethical breaches were found directly implicating him in misconduct. However, his role in Project 2025, which aims to undo many of the Biden administration’s policies, has reignited debates about his approach to housing policy.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
In Project 2025, Carson’s role involves significant input into federal housing policies, aiming to reset HUD by reversing policies implemented by the Biden administration and addressing issues such as housing stability and public housing management. His approach may prioritize conservative ideologies, potentially impacting federal housing support programs. Critics worry that these changes could undermine protections for vulnerable populations.</p>
