<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Acting Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
William Perry Pendley served as the Acting Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from July 2019 to September 2020 under the Trump administration. Pendley has a background in law and has been an outspoken advocate for private property rights and reducing federal land ownership. He previously served as the president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a conservative legal advocacy group. Pendley holds a JD from the University of Wyoming and a BA from George Washington University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
William Perry Pendley served as Acting Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from 2019 to 2021 under the Trump administration, although he was never confirmed by the Senate and his service was deemed unlawful by a judge. In the Project 2025 blueprint, Pendley advocates for the next Republican president to reduce the footprint of national monuments and restrict executive powers used to protect federal lands. He criticizes the Biden Interior Department’s approach to fossil fuel extraction and urges the reinstatement of Trump-era policies, including the Energy Dominance Agenda. Pendley believes his recommendations align with Trump’s first-term priorities and hopes they will be embraced by a future administration.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unlawful Appointment:</strong> Pendley’s appointment faced legal challenges, and in September 2020, a federal judge ruled that he had served unlawfully as Acting Director for over a year since his appointment had not been confirmed by the Senate. This ruling questioned the legality of his decisions during that period.</li>
  <li><strong>Views on Federal Land:</strong> Pendley’s past statements advocating for the sale of federal lands were widely criticized and sparked significant opposition from environmental groups, Indigenous tribes, and some lawmakers.</li>
  <li><strong>Project 2025:</strong> Pendley’s involvement in Project 2025, where he contributed to the Department of the Interior’s policy planning, has continued to draw attention and controversy due to the project’s aim to implement extensive changes in federal land management and conservation policies.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Pendley’s tenure at the BLM was marked by significant controversy due to his advocacy for selling federal lands, which critics argue is at odds with the agency’s mission to manage public lands for multiple uses and conservation. His leadership style and policy decisions during his time at the BLM have raised concerns about the future of public land management and conservation efforts.</p>
