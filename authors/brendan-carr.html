<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Brendan Carr was appointed to the FCC by President Trump and has served in various roles within the agency. Carr has nearly 20 years of experience in communications and tech policy, both in the public and private sectors. He previously served as the FCC’s General Counsel and worked as an attorney at Wiley Rein LLP. Carr is a graduate of Georgetown University and earned his JD magna cum laude from the Catholic University of America’s Columbus School of Law. He has been a vocal advocate for deregulation and enhancing the transparency of Big Tech companies. During the Trump administration, Carr supported strong measures against national security threats, particularly from the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Carr was appointed to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by President Trump and served in this role until his term expired in 2023. During his tenure, he worked closely with the Trump administration on telecommunications and national security policies. As the senior Republican on the FCC during Trump’s presidency, Carr was deeply involved in shaping regulatory approaches aligned with Trump’s policy framework. His contributions to Project 2025, advocating for substantial changes in the FCC’s regulatory approach, further reflect his alignment with Trump-era policies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
While not directly involved in any major scandals, Carr’s strong positions on Section 230 and Big Tech regulation have been controversial. His advocacy for reducing legal immunities for online platforms has sparked significant debate regarding free speech and government overreach in regulating digital platforms. Recently, House Democrats have called for an ethics investigation into Carr’s participation in Project 2025, questioning whether he improperly used his official position at the FCC to craft the project’s policy recommendations .</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Carr’s involvement in Project 2025 includes advocating for significant changes in the FCC’s regulatory approach, particularly around Big Tech and national security. His stance on interpreting Section 230 to reduce the immunities of online platforms could raise debates on free speech and censorship. Additionally, his alignment with the Trump administration’s policies may suggest a continued push for deregulation and conservative approaches to governance within the FCC .</p>
