<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Russ Vought served as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from July 2020 to January 2021, after previously serving as the Deputy Director. Before his tenure at OMB, Vought was Vice President of Heritage Action for America and held positions in Congress, including as a policy director for the House Republican Conference. He holds a BA from Wheaton College and a JD from George Washington University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Russ Vought was a key figure in the Trump administration, serving as Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from July 2020 until January 2021, following his roles as Deputy and Acting Director from 2018 to 2020. Vought played a central role in shaping the administration’s budget proposals and fiscal policies, focusing on reducing government spending and promoting economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation. His connection to Trump remains strong through his involvement with Project 2025, an initiative designed to prepare for a potential second Trump term by reshaping the federal government and advancing conservative policies. Recent secret footage published by the Centre for Climate Reporting reveals that Vought, who authored a chapter for Project 2025, claims Trump has expressed support for the project and is aligned with its goals.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Withholding of Ukraine Aid:</strong> Vought was involved in the controversial decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine, which was central to the first impeachment inquiry against President Trump. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) later found that the OMB had violated the law in withholding the aid.</li>
  <li><strong>Budget Cuts:</strong> His management of budget cuts to social services, healthcare programs, and other federal spending sparked significant public and political backlash, with critics arguing that these cuts disproportionately affected low-income and marginalized communities.</li>
  <li><strong>Project 2025:</strong> Vought has been a central figure in Project 2025, a controversial conservative blueprint for government reform. His candid remarks in a secretly recorded interview revealed plans for aggressive policy changes, including using the military to enforce law and order and dismantling various federal agencies. These revelations have sparked intense debate and concern about the potential impact of these policies on American democracy.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Vought’s tenure at OMB was marked by significant budget cuts and efforts to reduce the size of the federal government. Critics argue that his budgetary policies disproportionately impacted low-income and vulnerable populations. His strong advocacy for fiscal conservatism contributed to tensions over budget negotiations and government shutdowns. His current role in Project 2025 raises further concerns about his vision for radically transforming federal governance.</p>
