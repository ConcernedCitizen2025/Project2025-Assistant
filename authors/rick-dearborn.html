<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Legislative, Intergovernmental Affairs, and Implementation; currently a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Rick Dearborn served as the White House Deputy Chief of Staff in the Trump administration from January 2017 to March 2018. Before this role, he was the executive director of Trump’s presidential transition team and Chief of Staff to then-Senator Jeff Sessions. He has extensive experience in legislative and intergovernmental affairs, having worked with several Senate committees and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Currently, Dearborn is a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, where he contributes to Project 2025, an initiative focused on preparing a conservative policy framework and staffing plan for the next presidential administration.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Dearborn served as Deputy Chief of Staff in Trump’s White House from 2017 to 2018. Before Trump’s inauguration, he was the Staff Director of the presidential transition team. His close working relationship with Trump and key administration figures highlights his significant influence on the implementation of Trump’s policies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Russia Investigation:</strong> Dearborn’s name surfaced during the Russia investigation concerning an email he sent during the 2016 presidential campaign. However, he was granted testimonial immunity, and no major legal actions were taken against him.</li>
  <li><strong>House Judiciary Committee Subpoena:</strong> Dearborn was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee as part of broader investigations related to the Trump administration. This was part of the committee’s efforts to probe potential misconduct, though Dearborn did not face significant legal repercussions.</li>
  <li><strong>Project 2025:</strong> His involvement in Project 2025 has drawn attention due to the initiative’s controversial goal of reshaping the federal government. Critics argue that the project could lead to significant political and administrative upheaval if implemented.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Dearborn’s involvement in Project 2025 includes leveraging his experience in legislative affairs to support the development and implementation of conservative policies. His role may emphasize reducing federal government size and influence, aligning with the overall conservative agenda of Project 2025.</p>
