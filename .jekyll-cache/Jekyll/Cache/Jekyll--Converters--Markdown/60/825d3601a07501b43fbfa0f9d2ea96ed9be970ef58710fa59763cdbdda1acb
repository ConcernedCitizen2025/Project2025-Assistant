<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Resident Fellow in Law and Policy at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Andrew Art Arthur is a Resident Fellow in Law and Policy at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), where he focuses on immigration law and policy. Before joining CIS, Arthur served as an immigration judge in York, Pennsylvania, and held various positions within the U.S. government, including roles at the House Judiciary Committee and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). He holds a JD from George Washington University Law School and a BA from the University of Virginia.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Arthur‚Äôs role at CIS aligns closely with the immigration policies championed by the Trump administration, particularly its hardline stance on immigration enforcement. During Trump‚Äôs presidency, CIS and its fellows, including Arthur, were key advocates for stricter immigration controls, increased border security, and policies such as the ‚Äúzero-tolerance‚Äù policy that led to family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border. Arthur‚Äôs expertise and advocacy work provided intellectual support for many of these policies, contributing to the broader conversation on immigration reform during the Trump era.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Zero-Tolerance Policy:</strong> Arthur has been a staunch defender of the Trump administration‚Äôs ‚Äúzero-tolerance‚Äù policy, which led to the separation of thousands of families at the border. His support for this policy has drawn significant criticism, particularly from immigrant advocacy groups and human rights organizations.</li>
  <li><strong>Association with CIS:</strong> The Center for Immigration Studies, where Arthur is a fellow, has been labeled a hate group by organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center due to its perceived anti-immigrant stance. This association has placed Arthur at the center of contentious debates over immigration policy.</li>
  <li><strong>Congressional Testimonies:</strong> Arthur has frequently testified before Congress, where his views have sometimes sparked controversy, particularly when he defended policies that many view as harsh or inhumane, such as reducing protections for asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Arthur‚Äôs work at CIS, an organization known for advocating stricter immigration controls, has been controversial. Critics argue that the Center for Immigration Studies promotes anti-immigration policies that can be seen as xenophobic and overly restrictive. Arthur‚Äôs strong advocacy for enhanced immigration enforcement and policy changes that limit immigration have been points of significant debate.</p>
