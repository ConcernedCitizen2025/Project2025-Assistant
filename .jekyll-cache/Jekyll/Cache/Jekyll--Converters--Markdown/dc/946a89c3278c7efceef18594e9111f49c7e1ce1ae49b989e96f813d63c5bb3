<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) is a prominent conservative Christian legal advocacy group founded in 1993. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, ADF has significantly expanded its influence, with operations in Washington, D.C., New York, and internationally through its subsidiary, ADF International. The organization focuses on defending religious freedoms, opposing LGBTQ rights, and advocating for conservative Christian values in the legal and public policy arenas. ADF has been involved in numerous high-profile cases, including those challenging abortion rights and same-sex marriage.</p>

Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em> case that led to the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Marriage and Family:</strong> ADF opposes same-sex marriage and supports traditional definitions of marriage, having played a significant role in cases that allow businesses to refuse services for same-sex weddings based on religious beliefs.</li>
