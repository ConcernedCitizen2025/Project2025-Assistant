<p><strong>Position:</strong> President of Ginn Economic Consulting LLC</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Vance Ginn is the President of Ginn Economic Consulting LLC, where he provides economic research, analysis, and consulting services focused on fiscal policy, economic freedom, and taxation. He is also a Senior Fellow at several think tanks, including the Mackinac Center for Public Policy and the Texas Public Policy Foundation. Ginn served as the Associate Director for Economic Policy at the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during the Trump administration from 2019 to 2020. He holds a PhD in Economics from Texas Tech University and has extensive experience in both academic and policy research.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Vance Ginn’s role in the Trump administration as Associate Director for Economic Policy at the OMB directly involved him in shaping and implementing the administration’s economic policies. His work focused on promoting deregulation, tax cuts, and economic growth through free-market principles—core elements of Trump’s economic agenda. Ginn continues to advocate for these policies through his consulting firm and think tank affiliations.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Vance Ginn has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his strong advocacy for free-market policies, including opposition to government spending and regulation, has been contentious. Critics argue that his positions favor the wealthy and large corporations at the expense of lower-income individuals and essential public services. His involvement in controversial economic discussions, such as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, has also drawn criticism.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Ginn’s strong stance on reducing government intervention in the economy can be polarizing. While his policies are supported by advocates of limited government and economic freedom, they are often opposed by those who favor more progressive economic measures. His work in the Trump administration and ongoing advocacy for similar policies may attract scrutiny from opponents of deregulation and tax cuts.</p>
