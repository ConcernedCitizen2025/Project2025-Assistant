<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Heritage Foundation, established in 1973, is a leading conservative think tank in the United States. It promotes policies rooted in free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense. The foundation has significantly influenced public policy, especially during the Trump administration, and is spearheading Project 2025, a plan designed to reshape the federal government under a potential Trump presidency.</p>

  <li><strong>Public Policy Advocacy:</strong> Lobbying for conservative policies at federal and state levels.</li>
