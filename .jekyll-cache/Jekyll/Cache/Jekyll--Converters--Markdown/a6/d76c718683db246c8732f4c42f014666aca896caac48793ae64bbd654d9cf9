<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Senior Adviser, U.S. Census Bureau; American Principles Project</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Adam Korzeniewski is a combat veteran of the United States Marine Corps with significant experience in both government and the private sector. During the Trump administration, Korzeniewski held influential roles in the Treasury Department and Commerce Department, where he focused on financial policy, trade, industrial policy, technology, national security, and the census. Notably, he was involved in the 2020 Census operations, serving as a Senior Adviser to the Deputy Director at the U.S. Census Bureau. His work at the Treasury Department included contributing to financial policy initiatives that aligned with the Trump administration‚Äôs economic goals.</p>

<p>Korzeniewski‚Äôs educational background includes undergraduate studies at Columbia University and an executive education program at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Wharton School. In recognition of his expertise, President Trump appointed him to the Presidential Council for Improving Federal Civic Architecture in 2021, where he contributed to discussions on enhancing the aesthetic quality of federal buildings through the promotion of classical architecture. He was also selected as a 2021 Lincoln Fellow at the Claremont Institute, a prominent conservative think tank.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Adam Korzeniewski‚Äôs involvement in the Trump administration, particularly in the Treasury and Commerce Departments, placed him at the center of key initiatives related to the administration‚Äôs economic and industrial policies. His role in the 2020 Census was particularly significant as the Trump administration sought to introduce a citizenship question, which sparked widespread legal and public debate. Additionally, his appointment to the Presidential Council for Improving Federal Civic Architecture reflects Trump‚Äôs efforts to promote traditional and classical architectural styles for federal buildings‚Äîa move that was both symbolic and controversial.</p>

<p>Korzeniewski‚Äôs continued involvement in conservative advocacy through the American Principles Project (APP) and his connections with the Claremont Institute further align him with Trump‚Äôs political strategies and conservative agenda. The APP, where Korzeniewski is actively involved, is known for its strong support of policies that resonate with the Trump administration‚Äôs views on family, education, and social issues.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Census Bureau Role:</strong> Korzeniewski‚Äôs work at the Census Bureau during the 2020 Census was embroiled in controversy, particularly regarding the administration‚Äôs attempts to add a citizenship question. Critics argued that this move was intended to skew representation and federal resource allocation in favor of Republican-leaning areas, leading to several legal challenges.</li>
  <li><strong>Super PAC Involvement:</strong> Korzeniewski has been linked to the creation of a Super PAC aimed at supporting conservative candidates and causes. This initiative has sparked significant debate, particularly regarding its aggressive approach to opposing so-called ‚Äúwoke communism‚Äù and its impact on the political landscape.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Korzeniewski‚Äôs close alignment with the Trump administration and his role in contentious issues like the 2020 Census raise concerns about the politicization of federal data collection and public administration. His advocacy through the American Principles Project also positions him within a broader conservative movement that has been both influential and polarizing, especially in the context of ongoing cultural and political debates.</p>
