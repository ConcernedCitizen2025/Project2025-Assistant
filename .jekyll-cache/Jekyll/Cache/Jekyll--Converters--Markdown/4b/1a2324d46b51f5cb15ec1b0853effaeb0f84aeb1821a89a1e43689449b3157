<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Center for Renewing America (CRA) is a conservative think tank founded in 2021 by Russ Vought, former Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Donald Trump. CRA is committed to advancing an “America-first” agenda focused on traditional values, national sovereignty, and limiting government intervention. The organization has been instrumental in shaping conservative policy proposals, particularly those aligned with the Trump administration’s strategies.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>

Russ Vought, who is closely aligned with Trump, has been a key architect of this project, aiming to infuse Christian nationalist ideas into the administration’s policy framework.

While its efforts resonate with a segment of the American populace, the potential social and ethical implications of its policy proposals warrant careful scrutiny.
