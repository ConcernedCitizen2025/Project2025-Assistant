<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Chief of Staff, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
William R. Steiger is an experienced public health official who has served in several high-profile roles within the U.S. government. From 2017 to 2021, he was the Chief of Staff at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) during the Trump administration. In this role, Steiger was instrumental in aligning USAID‚Äôs operations with the administration‚Äôs foreign policy objectives, particularly in the areas of global health and development.</p>

<p>Before his tenure at USAID, Steiger held several significant positions, including Special Assistant to the Secretary for International Affairs and Director of the Office of Global Health Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from 2001 to 2009. In this capacity, he was a key figure in the implementation of the President‚Äôs Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and represented the U.S. at various international health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). His work during the George W. Bush administration established him as a prominent figure in global health policy.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
During the Trump administration, Steiger was appointed Chief of Staff at USAID, where he played a crucial role in executing the administration‚Äôs policies on global health and foreign aid. His leadership was critical in implementing the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy (often referred to as the Mexico City Policy), which prohibited U.S. funding to foreign organizations that perform or promote abortion. Steiger was also part of the ‚Äúbeachhead team‚Äù at the State Department, aiding in the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations, and advising on global health issues.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
William Steiger has faced criticism in the past, particularly during his time in the Bush administration, when he was involved in controversial decisions regarding the management of global health programs. His appointment to the Trump administration reignited some of these criticisms, especially given his role in shaping policies that were seen as heavily influenced by conservative and pro-life ideologies. Despite these controversies, Steiger has remained a respected figure in global health and policy circles.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Steiger‚Äôs strong alignment with conservative health policies, especially those that intersect with global health initiatives, has made him a polarizing figure. His influence in implementing policies like the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy has drawn both praise and criticism, reflecting the broader debates around U.S. foreign aid and its conditions under the Trump administration.</p>
