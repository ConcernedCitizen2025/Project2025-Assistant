<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Jonathan Butcher has not been involved in any major personal scandals. His work on education policy, however, places him at the center of ongoing debates about the future of public education in the United States. The promotion of school choice and charter schools is a divisive issue, attracting both strong support and vigorous opposition. These policy debates often involve significant public and political scrutiny.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
