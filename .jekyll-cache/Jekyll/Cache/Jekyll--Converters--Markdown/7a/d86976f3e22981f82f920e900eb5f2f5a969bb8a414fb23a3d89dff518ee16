<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Research Fellow for Regional Economics in the Center for Data Analysis at the Heritage Foundation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
EJ Antoni is a Research Fellow at the Heritage Foundation specializing in regional economics and economic policy analysis. He focuses on fiscal and monetary policy, providing insights into taxation, government spending, and economic growth. Antoni holds a PhD in Economics from Northern Illinois University and a BA from the University of Notre Dame. Before joining the Heritage Foundation, he worked as an economist at the Texas Public Policy Foundation and served as an economic consultant for FreedomWorks, where he contributed to empirical analysis on various economic issues.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
EJ Antoniâ€™s work aligns closely with the economic policies promoted by the Trump administration, such as tax cuts, deregulation, and opposition to excessive government spending. While he did not hold a formal position within the Trump administration, his research and advocacy through the Heritage Foundation supported many of the administrationâ€™s economic initiatives, particularly those that prioritized economic growth through deregulation and lower taxes.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
EJ Antoni has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, his affiliation with the Heritage Foundation, a think tank known for its conservative stance, and his vocal support for policies that benefit from deregulation and reduced government intervention, have sparked debate and criticism. The think tankâ€™s positions on economic issues, such as opposition to minimum wage increases and support for entitlement reform, have been contentious and subject to public scrutiny.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Antoniâ€™s strong advocacy for conservative economic principles, such as lower taxes and reduced government spending, often faces criticism for potentially favoring the wealthy and exacerbating income inequality. His affiliation with the Heritage Foundation may also raise concerns about the objectivity of his research, given the think tankâ€™s influential role in shaping conservative policy.</p>
