<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Recovery for America Now Foundation (RANF) is a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., dedicated to providing access to addiction treatment for individuals suffering from substance use disorders. Founded by Dr. Arthur Kleinschmidt, RANF aims to close the treatment gap by offering scholarships to those in need, ensuring that financial barriers do not prevent access to recovery. The foundation operates on the belief that treatment is the beginning of a lifelong journey towards recovery and fulfillment.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>RANFâ€™s mission is to make treatment accessible to all individuals suffering from addiction. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scholarships for Treatment:</strong> RANF provides financial assistance to individuals who need help covering the costs of addiction treatment. The foundation collaborates with a network of treatment centers to identify and support those in need, making recovery possible for a broader population.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy Advocacy:</strong> RANF advocates for policy changes to expand treatment capacity and influence policies that support recovery and independence. This includes efforts to repeal regulations like the IMD exclusion, which limits federal Medicaid financing for residential treatment facilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Lifelong Recovery Support:</strong> The foundation builds a community among alumni, focusing on education, employment, and life skills development to ensure long-term success and well-being in recovery.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>While RANF primarily focuses on addiction recovery, some of its board members, such as Joe Grogan, have connections to the Trump administration. Grogan served as the Director of the Domestic Policy Council under Trump, where he was involved in healthcare and drug policy. These connections suggest an alignment with broader conservative approaches to healthcare and drug policy.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political and Regulatory Challenges:</strong> RANFâ€™s efforts to influence policy, such as repealing the IMD exclusion, face significant regulatory hurdles. These challenges can impact the availability of treatment, funding, and support for individuals in need.</li>
  <li><strong>Stigma and Public Perception:</strong> Combating the stigma associated with addiction remains a critical challenge. RANF works to shift public perception and advocate for understanding addiction as a medical condition rather than a moral failing.</li>
