<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Scholar at The Fund for American Studies; former Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) during President Ronald Reagan’s first term</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Donald Devine served as Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) during President Ronald Reagan’s first term, where he was known for reducing the federal workforce and cutting bureaucracy. Devine has been a professor at the University of Maryland and Bellevue University and is a columnist and author of 10 books. His recent work includes <em>The Enduring Tension</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Devine’s approach to federal workforce management and bureaucracy aligns with the Trump administration’s deregulatory and decentralization efforts. Although he did not hold an official position in the Trump administration, his policy perspectives resonate with the administration’s objectives to streamline federal operations and reduce regulatory burdens. His involvement in Project 2025, where he advocates for reducing the size and scope of federal agencies, further aligns him with Trump’s vision for federal governance.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Devine has not been directly involved in major scandals. However, his tenure at OPM during the Reagan administration was marked by controversy due to his aggressive measures to cut the federal workforce and reduce spending, which faced opposition from labor unions and federal employees. These actions reflect his commitment to reducing government size, a stance that remains controversial among advocates of a strong federal workforce.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
In Project 2025, Devine’s focus is likely on reducing the size and scope of federal government agencies, reflecting his historical emphasis on cutting bureaucracy. His proposals might involve significant workforce reductions and policy changes aimed at decentralizing federal power, which could be contentious among federal employees and those who support a robust federal government. Critics argue that these measures could weaken the effectiveness of federal services and undermine public trust in government institutions.</p>
