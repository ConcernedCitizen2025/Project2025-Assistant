<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Travis Fisher is a Senior Research Fellow in Energy and Environmental Policy at The Heritage Foundation, where he focuses on energy markets, regulatory policy, and environmental issues. Fisher has extensive experience in energy policy, having previously worked at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Institute for Energy Research. He also served as an economist for the Department of Energy during the Trump administration, where he was involved in critical energy policy decisions. Fisher holds a degree in Economics from North Carolina State University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Travis Fisherâ€™s policy positions and work at The Heritage Foundation align closely with many of the energy and environmental policies promoted by the Trump administration, which emphasized deregulation, energy independence, and support for fossil fuel industries. Fisherâ€™s role in the Department of Energy during Trumpâ€™s presidency involved contributing to energy policies that favored traditional energy sources over renewable energy, aligning with the administrationâ€™s broader goals.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Travis Fisher has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his work on energy policy, particularly his advocacy for deregulation and support for fossil fuels, places him at the center of ongoing debates about the future of energy policy in the United States. His involvement in a controversial grid study during the Trump administration, which was criticized for its potential bias against clean energy, has been a focal point of criticism from environmental advocates.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Fisherâ€™s strong advocacy for deregulation in the energy sector and his support for fossil fuels can be contentious. Critics argue that such positions may undermine efforts to address climate change and transition to renewable energy sources. His stance on reducing environmental regulations can attract opposition from environmental groups and those advocating for more aggressive climate policies.</p>
