<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Vice President of Policy and Strategy at Locomation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Finch Fulton is the Vice President of Policy and Strategy at Locomation, a company specializing in autonomous trucking technology. Before joining Locomation, Fulton served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) during the Trump administration. In this role, he was involved in developing and implementing transportation policies focused on innovation, infrastructure, and regulatory reform, with a particular emphasis on emerging transportation technologies such as autonomous vehicles. Fulton holds a degree from the University of Alabama and has a background in public policy and transportation.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Fulton’s role as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy placed him within the Trump administration, where he was involved in key transportation initiatives, including efforts to modernize infrastructure and promote innovation in transportation technology. His work supported the administration’s priorities of deregulation and private sector-led innovation, particularly in the area of autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
While Finch Fulton has not been involved in any major personal scandals, his advocacy for autonomous vehicles and his subsequent move to Locomation, a company that directly benefits from the policies he helped shape, have raised some concerns about the revolving door between government and industry. Additionally, Locomation faced significant challenges in 2023, including layoffs and financial difficulties, leading to public scrutiny and concerns about the viability of the autonomous trucking sector.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Fulton’s work in transportation policy, particularly in the rapidly evolving field of autonomous vehicles, can be contentious. Critics may argue that policies favoring rapid deployment of autonomous technology could overlook safety, labor, and regulatory concerns. His transition from a government role to a senior position in a private sector company that benefits from those policies might also raise questions about potential conflicts of interest.</p>
