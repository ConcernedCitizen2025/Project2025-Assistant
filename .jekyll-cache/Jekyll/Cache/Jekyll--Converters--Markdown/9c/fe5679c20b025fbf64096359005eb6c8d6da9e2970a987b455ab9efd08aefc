<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Legates was appointed as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Observation and Prediction at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) during the Trump administration in 2020. His appointment was controversial due to his skeptical views on human-caused climate change, which aligned with the administrationâ€™s approach to climate science. He later worked in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, where he was involved in the creation of climate change briefing documents that sparked significant criticism.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
David Legates has been a controversial figure in the climate science community, largely due to his rejection of the mainstream scientific consensus on climate change. His research has been funded by organizations such as Koch Industries and ExxonMobil, leading to further scrutiny and debate. In his role at NOAA under the Trump administration, he faced backlash for distributing documents that challenged widely accepted climate science under the guise of official White House publications, which led to his termination from the White House position.</p>
