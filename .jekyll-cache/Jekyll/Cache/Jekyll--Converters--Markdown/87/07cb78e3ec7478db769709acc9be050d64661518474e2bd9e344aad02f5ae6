<p><strong>Position:</strong> CEO of Classical Conversations</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Robert Bortins is the CEO of Classical Conversations, a company that provides Christian-centered homeschooling curricula and resources. Under his leadership, Classical Conversations has expanded significantly, becoming a prominent player in the homeschooling movement, particularly among Christian families. Bortins, who holds a BS in Industrial Engineering from Clemson University, was also homeschooled, which gives him a personal connection to the community he now leads. The organization emphasizes the classical method of education, focusing on grammar, logic, and rhetoric, and serves families in over 50 countries.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Robert Bortins does not have a direct connection to the Trump administration. However, the broader movement for educational choice, which includes homeschooling, received support from figures in the Trump administration, such as former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. DeVos advocated for school choice and reducing federal oversight in education, positions that align with the homeschooling advocacy led by Bortins and Classical Conversations.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Robert Bortins has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, the company he leads, Classical Conversations, operates within a contentious field where debates over the efficacy and appropriateness of homeschooling are ongoing. The organizationâ€™s strong emphasis on Christian values also places it at the center of discussions about the role of religion in education.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
As CEO of a major homeschooling organization, Bortinsâ€™ work can be seen in the broader context of debates over educational standards, regulation, and the effectiveness of homeschooling compared to traditional public schooling. Critics of homeschooling argue that it can lead to inconsistent educational outcomes and lack of socialization opportunities for students. Additionally, the strong Christian orientation of Classical Conversations may be seen as controversial in the context of debates over the separation of church and state in education.</p>
