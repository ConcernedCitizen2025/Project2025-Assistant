<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
LaCerte’s tenure as Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs (LDVA) was marred by controversy.

The investigations uncovered issues such as improper use of funds, questionable hiring practices, and a failure to report crimes involving veterans under the LDVA’s care. These findings led to significant public scrutiny, although LaCerte has vehemently denied the allegations, calling the reports “garbage” and pursuing defamation lawsuits against the state and its officials.</p>
