<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Forge Leadership Network (FLN) is a conservative organization founded to mentor and train young conservative leaders aged 18-25. Based in Dayton, Ohio, FLN was co-founded by Adam Josefczyk and Justin Powell in 2015. The organization aims to equip the next generation of leaders in politics, culture, and business by instilling principles of limited government, Judeo-Christian ethics, and economic freedom. FLN provides a platform for young conservatives to connect with influential leaders and gain practical experience in the political and cultural arenas (<a href="https://forgeleadership.org">Forge Leadership Network</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>FLNâ€™s mission is to mentor, train, and connect young conservatives through its two primary programs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Forge Leadership Summit:</strong> A five-day intensive program that includes training sessions, professional development, and talks from leading conservative speakers. Participants engage in activities such as mock political campaigns, legislative simulations, and media training.

  <li><strong>Forge Mentorship Academy:</strong> A year-long program offering experiential learning in politics, training in argumentation, and networking opportunities.

</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>FLN has connections to influential conservative figures and organizations, including the Heritage Foundation, Alliance Defending Freedom, and the Family Research Council. These connections highlight its integration into the broader conservative movement and its alignment with the America-first agenda promoted by the Trump administration (<a href="https://forgeleadership.org">Forge Leadership Network</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>).</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Bias:</strong> FLNâ€™s strong conservative orientation and connections to right-wing organizations could indicate a potential bias in its training and advocacy efforts. This raises questions about the diversity of perspectives presented to participants (<a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Lobbying Activities:</strong> There have been concerns that FLNâ€™s activities, such as advancing model legislation and candidate briefings, may cross into lobbying, which could challenge its non-profit status (<a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Forge Leadership Network is a significant player in training and mentoring young conservative leaders in the U.S. Its programs are designed to prepare participants for roles in politics, culture, and business rooted in conservative principles. However, its strong ideological stance and potential lobbying activities warrant careful scrutiny to ensure a balanced and legal approach to its advocacy (<a href="https://forgeleadership.org">Forge Leadership Network</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org">SourceWatch</a>).</p>
