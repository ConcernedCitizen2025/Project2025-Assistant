<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
David Gortler is a Senior Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), where he focuses on health policy, drug safety, and regulatory affairs. With a PharmD and PhD in Pharmacology from the University of California, San Francisco, Gortler has an extensive background in healthcare and regulatory policy. He previously served as a Senior Advisor to the FDA Commissioner during the Trump administration, where he was involved in drug safety oversight and the development of regulatory policies. His work at EPPC continues to reflect his expertise in these areas, advocating for reforms and greater accountability within federal health agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Gortlerâ€™s role as a Senior Advisor to the FDA Commissioner under the Trump administration placed him at the center of key regulatory and health policy decisions. His current work at EPPC aligns with the deregulatory and reform-oriented policies that were characteristic of the Trump administration. His involvement in Project 2025, a conservative policy initiative preparing for a potential future Republican administration, further ties his work to the ongoing legacy of Trump-era policies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
David Gortler has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his work on drug regulation and health policy, particularly his critiques of the FDAâ€™s handling of COVID-19 vaccine safety and his advocacy for regulatory reforms, has sparked significant debate. His positions are often polarizing, especially in discussions about the balance between regulatory oversight and market freedom in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Gortlerâ€™s strong views on drug regulation and health policy can be contentious. Critics argue that his emphasis on deregulation and market-based solutions might prioritize industry interests over patient safety and public health. His role in both the FDA and EPPC positions him in the middle of debates over the appropriate level of government intervention in healthcare and drug safety.</p>
