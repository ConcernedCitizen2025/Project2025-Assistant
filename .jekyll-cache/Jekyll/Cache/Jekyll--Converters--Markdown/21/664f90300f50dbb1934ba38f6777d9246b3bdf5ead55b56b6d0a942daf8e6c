<p><strong>Position:</strong> Acting Deputy Secretary for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) during the Trump Administration</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Ken Cuccinelli served in multiple high-ranking roles within the Trump administration focusing on immigration and homeland security. He was a prominent advocate for the administrationâ€™s hardline immigration policies, including the controversial public charge rule that restricted immigrantsâ€™ access to public benefits. Cuccinelli has a background in law and politics, having previously served as Attorney General of Virginia.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Cuccinelli served as the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security from 2019 to 2021. His appointment was controversial, with a 2020 congressional watchdog report declaring it unlawful. Despite this, Cuccinelli played a crucial role in advancing Trumpâ€™s immigration policies, reflecting his alignment with Trumpâ€™s hardline stance on immigration and border security.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Cuccinelli has been involved in several controversies, particularly related to his immigration policies and the legality of his appointments. His role in implementing the public charge rule and other restrictive immigration policies has been widely criticized. Additionally, a court ruled that his appointment as the Acting Director of USCIS was not legal, raising questions about the administrationâ€™s adherence to federal appointment laws.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
In Project 2025, Cuccinelliâ€™s role likely involves shaping immigration and homeland security policies. His strong stance on immigration reform, including measures to limit legal immigration and increase enforcement against illegal immigration, aligns with conservative viewpoints but may be seen as extreme and exclusionary by opponents.</p>
