<p><strong>Position:</strong> Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, Former Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Tom Homan served as the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from January 2017 to June 2018 under President Donald Trump. In this role, he was a prominent advocate for strict immigration enforcement policies, including the controversial family separation policy aimed at deterring illegal immigration. Homan has a long career in law enforcement, beginning as a police officer in West Carthage, New York, and including roles within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Border Patrol. He is currently a Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, where he continues to advocate for strong immigration enforcement policies.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Tom Homan was a significant figure in the Trump administrationâ€™s immigration policy framework. He was a vocal supporter of President Trumpâ€™s immigration strategies and has expressed a willingness to serve in a similar capacity if Trump were to be re-elected. Homanâ€™s policies and public statements closely align with Trumpâ€™s vision for U.S. immigration enforcement, and he has been involved in discussions surrounding Project 2025, a plan to shape future immigration policy under a potential second Trump administration.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Homanâ€™s implementation of the family separation policy remains one of the most controversial aspects of his career. The policy, which separated children from their parents at the border, drew widespread criticism for its humanitarian impact. Homan has consistently defended the policy as a necessary deterrent to illegal immigration. His aggressive stance on immigration continues to be polarizing, attracting both support from those advocating for stricter immigration policies and criticism from those who view these measures as overly harsh and inhumane.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Homanâ€™s tenure at ICE and his ongoing advocacy for strict immigration enforcement policies have made him a polarizing figure. The family separation policy, in particular, has been a focal point of criticism, with many arguing that it caused undue harm to families and violated human rights. His involvement in shaping future immigration policies under Project 2025 also raises concerns about the potential direction of U.S. immigration enforcement in a future Trump administration.</p>
