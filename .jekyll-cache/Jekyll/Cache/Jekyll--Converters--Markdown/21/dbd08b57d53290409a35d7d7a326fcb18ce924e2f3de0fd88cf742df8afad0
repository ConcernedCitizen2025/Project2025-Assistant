<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Matt Bowman serves as Senior Counsel and Director of Regulatory Practice at Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), where he specializes in administrative law with a focus on religious freedom, the sanctity of life, and family values. Bowman has been with ADF for over a decade and has played a key role in numerous high-profile legal cases, particularly those challenging government mandates that conflict with religious beliefs. He has a JD from Ave Maria School of Law, where he graduated summa cum laude, and a BA from the University of Notre Dame. Before joining ADF, Bowman clerked for several prominent judges, including Justice Samuel Alito during his time on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Matt Bowmanâ€™s work closely aligns with many of the policy positions taken by the Trump administration, particularly in defending religious liberty and opposing mandates like the Affordable Care Actâ€™s contraceptive coverage requirement. Bowman also served in the Trump administration as Deputy General Counsel and in the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from 2017 to 2020, where he was involved in key regulatory and legal initiatives that reflected the administrationâ€™s priorities.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Matt Bowman has been involved in several contentious legal battles due to his work with ADF, particularly in cases that challenge the rights of LGBTQ individuals and access to reproductive healthcare. These cases, such as those opposing the Affordable Care Actâ€™s contraceptive mandate and supporting religious employersâ€™ rights to refuse services based on their beliefs, have sparked significant public and legal debate. Critics argue that ADFâ€™s positions, which Bowman helps advocate, promote discrimination under the guise of religious freedom.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Bowmanâ€™s advocacy work, especially on cases related to religious freedom and opposition to LGBTQ rights, has been highly controversial. Critics, including civil rights groups, often challenge the impact of ADFâ€™s legal strategies, arguing they undermine civil rights protections in favor of religious exemptions. This has placed Bowman and ADF at the center of ongoing and heated public debates.</p>
