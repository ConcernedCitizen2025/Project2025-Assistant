<p><strong>Position:</strong> Executive Director at The Institute for Women‚Äôs Health</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Dr. Alma Golden is the Executive Director of The Institute for Women‚Äôs Health, an organization focused on promoting women‚Äôs health and well-being globally. A pediatrician by training, Dr. Golden has extensive experience in healthcare policy and administration. She served as the Assistant Administrator for Global Health at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) during the Trump administration, where she was responsible for overseeing significant global health initiatives. Her prior roles include serving as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the George W. Bush administration. Dr. Golden holds an MD from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Alma Golden‚Äôs role as Assistant Administrator for Global Health at USAID during the Trump administration placed her at the forefront of implementing policies that reflected the administration‚Äôs conservative stance on global health issues. This included the expansion of the ‚ÄúGlobal Gag Rule,‚Äù which restricted U.S. aid to organizations that provide or promote abortion services. Her work at USAID and her current leadership at The Institute for Women‚Äôs Health continue to align with principles that were central to the Trump administration‚Äôs health policy goals.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Global Gag Rule:</strong> Dr. Golden played a key role in enforcing the Trump administration‚Äôs expanded Global Gag Rule, which was widely criticized for its impact on global health services, particularly in restricting access to reproductive health care in developing countries. Despite significant evidence of the rule‚Äôs negative effects on healthcare access, Dr. Golden defended the policy, which has been a point of contention among health advocates and organizations.</li>
  <li><strong>Abstinence-Only Advocacy:</strong> Throughout her career, Dr. Golden has been a staunch advocate for abstinence-only education, both in domestic and international contexts. This position has been controversial, especially among proponents of comprehensive sexual education who argue that abstinence-only programs are less effective in preventing teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Golden‚Äôs leadership roles in health policy, particularly her involvement in policies that align with conservative views on reproductive rights and family planning, have been highly contentious. Her work is subject to intense public and political scrutiny, especially from organizations that oppose the restrictive measures she has supported in the realm of reproductive health.</p>
