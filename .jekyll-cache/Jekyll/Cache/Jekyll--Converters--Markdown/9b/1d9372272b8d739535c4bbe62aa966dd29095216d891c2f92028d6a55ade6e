<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Adjunct Professor of Economics at George Washington University, Senior Fellow at The Heritage Foundation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Diana Furchtgott-Roth is an economist who serves as an Adjunct Professor of Economics at George Washington University and a Senior Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, where she directs the Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment. She previously held significant positions in the Trump administration, including Deputy Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Furchtgott-Roth has a BA in Economics from Swarthmore College and an MPhil in Economics from Oxford University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
During the Trump administration, Furchtgott-Roth was involved in promoting deregulation and innovation in transportation as Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Department of Transportation. Her policy work at The Heritage Foundation continues to align closely with Trump-era priorities, particularly in advocating for deregulation and market-driven approaches in economic and environmental policies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Diana Furchtgott-Roth has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, her advocacy for deregulation and free-market policies often places her in the midst of contentious public policy debates, especially regarding environmental regulations and labor standards. These debates reflect broader disagreements over the balance between economic growth and regulatory oversight.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Furchtgott-Rothâ€™s strong advocacy for free-market principles and deregulation can be polarizing. Critics argue that such positions may lead to insufficient regulation, potentially compromising public safety, worker protections, and environmental standards. Her work in the Trump administration, particularly her efforts to roll back regulations, has attracted both support and criticism from different segments of the public and policymakers.</p>
