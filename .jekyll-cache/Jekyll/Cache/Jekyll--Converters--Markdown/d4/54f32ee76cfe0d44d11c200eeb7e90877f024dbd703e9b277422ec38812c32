<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>FreedomWorks was a conservative and libertarian advocacy group founded in 1984, known for its strong emphasis on free-market principles, limited government, and individual liberty. Based in Washington, D.C., the organization played a crucial role in promoting the Tea Party movement and influencing economic and regulatory policies during the Trump administration. FreedomWorks mobilized grassroots activists, conducted research, and engaged in public policy advocacy to promote its ideological goals. However, the organization faced significant internal and external challenges, particularly during the Trump era, which eventually led to its closure in May 2024 (<a href="https://www.freedomworks.org">FreedomWorks</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreedomWorks">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.influencewatch.org">InfluenceWatch</a>).</p>
