<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Senior Counsel, Senate Judiciary Committee; Senior Advisor to the Assistant Secretary of HUD, 2017-2021</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Robert Bowes served as Senior Counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Trump administration, where he was involved in advising on legal matters, legislative drafting, and oversight responsibilities. He later served as a Senior Advisor to the Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from 2017 to 2021. In this role, he was involved in various policy initiatives, including advising senior administration officials like Stephen Miller. Bowes holds a JD from Georgetown University Law Center, a BS from Indiana University, and has held significant roles in the banking and financial sectors, including Vice-President of Chase Manhattan Bank and Director of Counterparty Risk at Fannie Mae.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Robert Bowes played a key role in the Trump administration, particularly through his work at HUD and his involvement in supporting Trumpâ€™s policies. He was also a Field Director for Trumpâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign. His contributions to Project 2025, a plan aimed at shaping future government administration under a potential Trump presidency, further align him with Trumpâ€™s agenda. Bowes authored a chapter in the Project 2025 playbook, advocating for the abolition of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a stance consistent with Trumpâ€™s deregulatory goals.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
During his tenure at HUD, Robert Bowes was scrutinized for engaging in frequent and high-stakes stock trades, including options trading, which raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and insider trading. Despite denying any wrongdoing, the nature of these trades, described by ethics experts as akin to day trading, brought significant attention and criticism. His financial activities during his government service were viewed as unusual for a senior official, contributing to the controversy surrounding his nomination to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Bowesâ€™ involvement in high-profile financial activities while serving in the Trump administration, particularly the controversies around his stock trading, may raise ethical concerns and questions about his commitment to public service principles. His advocacy for the dismantling of regulatory bodies like the CFPB could also be seen as part of a broader agenda to reduce oversight of the financial industry, aligning with deregulatory efforts that are often criticized for favoring corporate interests over consumer protection.</p>
