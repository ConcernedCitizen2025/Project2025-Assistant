<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Resident Scholar, Center for Immigration Studies</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Jason Richwine is a political commentator and scholar known for his work on immigration and public policy. He holds a Ph.D. in Public Policy from Harvard University, where his dissertation focused on the relationship between IQ and immigration. This work, which controversially argued that Hispanic immigrants tend to have lower IQs than non-Hispanic whites, has been a source of significant debate and criticism.</p>

<p>Richwine began his career at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) before joining The Heritage Foundation, where he co-authored a widely criticized report on the economic impact of immigration reform. The backlash from this report and his previous academic work led to his resignation from The Heritage Foundation in 2013. Richwine later joined the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a think tank known for advocating reduced immigration.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
During the final months of the Trump administration, Richwine was appointed to a position at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), reflecting the administration‚Äôs alignment with his views on immigration. His work at CIS also aligns with the Trump administration‚Äôs restrictive immigration policies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Richwine has been involved in multiple controversies, primarily due to his work on race and IQ. His dissertation and subsequent writings have been labeled as promoting racially charged ideas, drawing criticism from various quarters, including fellow scholars and civil rights organizations. His association with the now-infamous ‚ÄúIQ and Immigration Policy‚Äù thesis continues to influence public perceptions of his work.</p>
