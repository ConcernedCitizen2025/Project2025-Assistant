During his tenure, he worked closely with the Trump administration on telecommunications and national security policies. As the senior Republican on the FCC during Trumpâ€™s presidency, Carr was deeply involved in shaping regulatory approaches aligned with Trumpâ€™s policy framework. His contributions to Project 2025, advocating for substantial changes in the FCCâ€™s regulatory approach, further reflect his alignment with Trump-era policies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
While not directly involved in any major scandals, Carrâ€™s strong positions on Section 230 and Big Tech regulation have been controversial. His advocacy for reducing legal immunities for online platforms has sparked significant debate regarding free speech and government overreach in regulating digital platforms. Recently, House Democrats have called for an ethics investigation into Carrâ€™s participation in Project 2025, questioning whether he improperly used his official position at the FCC to craft the projectâ€™s policy recommendations .</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Carrâ€™s involvement in Project 2025 includes advocating for significant changes in the FCCâ€™s regulatory approach, particularly around Big Tech and national security. His stance on interpreting Section 230 to reduce the immunities of online platforms could raise debates on free speech and censorship. Additionally, his alignment with the Trump administrationâ€™s policies may suggest a continued push for deregulation and conservative approaches to governance within the FCC .</p>
