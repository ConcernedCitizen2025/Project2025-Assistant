<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Peter Navarro served as the Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy during the Trump administration.

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Peter Navarro was a prominent member of the Trump administration, serving as Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy from 2017 to 2021 and as Director of the National Trade Council in 2017. As a close adviser to Trump, Navarro was instrumental in shaping trade policies, including tariffs on Chinese goods and the renegotiation of NAFTA into the USMCA. His role extended to advising on the COVID-19 response and supporting Trumpâ€™s false claims of election fraud. Navarro was indicted for contempt of Congress by a grand jury, pled guilty, and was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $9,500. He was released from prison just before the RNC.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Trade Policies:</strong> Navarroâ€™s tariffs and trade restrictions have been criticized for potentially escalating trade wars and increasing costs for American consumers.</li>
  <li><strong>COVID-19 Pandemic:</strong> He faced criticism for his role in the Trump administrationâ€™s handling of the pandemic, particularly in the procurement and distribution of medical supplies.</li>
  <li><strong>Prison Sentence Related to January 6 Committee Subpoena:</strong> Peter Navarro became the first ex-White House official to be imprisoned due to a contempt of Congress conviction after defying a subpoena related to the January 6 Capitol riot, though he wonâ€™t be the last. Following his brief prison sentence, he was released ahead of an RNC event. Meanwhile, Steve Bannon, a Trump associate and former White House chief strategist, is currently serving a four-month federal prison sentence in Connecticut for similarly refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House select committee.</li>
  <li><strong>Book and Public Statements:</strong> His book <em>In Trump Time</em> and public remarks have sparked debates over the accuracy of his portrayal of events during his time in the administration.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Navarroâ€™s strong stance on trade, particularly his adversarial position towards China, has been a point of significant contention. His policies aimed at reducing trade deficits and bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States have been criticized for potentially escalating trade wars and increasing costs for American consumers and businesses. Navarroâ€™s unconventional economic views and aggressive rhetoric have often been polarizing.</p>
