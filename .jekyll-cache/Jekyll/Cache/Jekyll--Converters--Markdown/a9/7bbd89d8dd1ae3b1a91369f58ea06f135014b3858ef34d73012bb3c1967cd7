<strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Michael Sweeneyâ€™s role as Associate Managing Director at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during the Trump administration placed him in a pivotal position for managing communications policy and operations. While his position at the FCC involved overseeing internal processes and supporting the Chairmanâ€™s office, Sweeneyâ€™s work intersected with the Trump administrationâ€™s broader objectives in communications regulation and policy.</p>

<p>Under Chairman Ajit Pai, who was appointed by Trump, the FCC pursued several significant policy changes, including the rollback of net neutrality regulations. Sweeneyâ€™s role likely involved supporting these initiatives and ensuring that the FCCâ€™s operations aligned with the administrationâ€™s agenda. His responsibilities would have included implementing and managing the administrative aspects of these policy changes, which were central to Trumpâ€™s deregulatory approach to communications and technology.</p>

<p>Sweeneyâ€™s tenure at the FCC reflects his involvement in the Trump administrationâ€™s efforts to reshape communications policy, although his specific contributions may have been more administrative and operational in nature compared to the policy-making roles of the Chairman and Commissioners.</p>
