CIS is a prominent player in the immigration policy debate, providing research and policy recommendations that support reducing immigration. The organization has been influential in shaping public discourse and immigration policy, particularly during the Trump administration.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>

<ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>CIS had significant influence on the Trump administration‚Äôs immigration policies. The organization‚Äôs research and recommendations aligned closely with Trump‚Äôs immigration agenda, emphasizing border security and reducing immigration levels. CIS played a consulting role during Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign and continued to influence policy throughout his presidency. Despite this alignment, Krikorian himself expressed skepticism about Trump, referring to him as a ‚Äúbloviating megalomaniac‚Äù before later supporting the administration‚Äôs policies.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Bias:</strong> CIS‚Äôs strong stance on reducing immigration has drawn criticism from pro-immigration groups, who argue that the organization‚Äôs research is influenced by an anti-immigration bias. Critics also point to connections between CIS and individuals or groups promoting white nationalist views, which has fueled controversy.</li>
  <li><strong>Controversial Positions:</strong> CIS has been involved in contentious debates over immigration policy, with some positions criticized for fostering negative perceptions of immigrants. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has designated CIS as a hate group, a label that CIS disputes, arguing that it is based on disagreement with its policy positions rather than any promotion of hate.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Center for Immigration Studies is a major force in the immigration policy debate in the U.S., with a significant impact on public discourse and policy, especially during the Trump administration. However, its strong stance on reducing immigration and the controversies surrounding its positions and associations warrant careful scrutiny of its research and recommendations.</p>
