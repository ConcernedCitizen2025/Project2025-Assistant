<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Center for Family and Human Rights (C-FAM) is a conservative advocacy group founded in 1997, originally known as the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute. The organization was established to influence social policy debates at the United Nations and other international institutions, focusing on upholding conservative values concerning life and family. C-FAM has been a vocal opponent of abortion, same-sex marriage, and gender identity policies, positioning itself as a defender of traditional human rights interpretations (<a href="https://c-fam.org">C-FAM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Family_and_Human_Rights">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>C-FAM has connections to the Trump administration through its advocacy work and involvement in international policy debates. The organization’s alignment with Trump’s pro-life and pro-family agenda is evident in its support for policies that restrict abortion and promote traditional family structures. C-FAM is also a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative to shape conservative policy for a future Republican administration (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Family_and_Human_Rights">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Controversial Positions:</strong> C-FAM’s strong stance on issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and gender identity has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that the organization’s positions may undermine broader human rights efforts, particularly those related to LGBTQ rights and reproductive health. Additionally, C-FAM’s collaboration with repressive governments to resist international recognition of LGBTQ rights raises further concerns about its impact on global human rights norms (<a href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org">Right Wing Watch</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Family_and_Human_Rights">Wikipedia</a>).</li>
