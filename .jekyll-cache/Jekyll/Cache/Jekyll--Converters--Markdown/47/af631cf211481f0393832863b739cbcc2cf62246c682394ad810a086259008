<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Chief of Staff and General Counsel, Office of Governor Kristi Noem</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Mark Miller served as the Chief of Staff for South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, beginning his tenure in late 2021 after previously working as the Governorâ€™s General Counsel. During his time in office, Miller was instrumental in advancing Governor Noemâ€™s legislative agenda, including efforts to restrict the authority of Game, Fish, and Parks conservation officers. His approach sometimes led to contentious interactions with the state legislature. Miller stepped down in mid-2023, citing family reasons and a move back to Florida to work with a nonprofit organization.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Mark Millerâ€™s connection to Donald Trump is primarily through his association with Governor Kristi Noem, a prominent Trump ally known for her alignment with many of Trumpâ€™s conservative policies. During Millerâ€™s tenure as Chief of Staff, Governor Noem supported Trumpâ€™s positions on various issues, including election integrity and anti-immigration measures. Noemâ€™s policies and political stance often mirrored Trumpâ€™s agenda, which suggests that Millerâ€™s work was indirectly influenced by and supportive of Trumpâ€™s broader conservative objectives. His role in South Dakotaâ€™s legislative efforts, particularly in shaping conservative policy positions, reflects the influence of Trumpâ€™s political and ideological framework.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Millerâ€™s tenure was marked by intense legislative debates, particularly over conservation and transgender issues, but no significant scandals were associated with him personally.</p>
