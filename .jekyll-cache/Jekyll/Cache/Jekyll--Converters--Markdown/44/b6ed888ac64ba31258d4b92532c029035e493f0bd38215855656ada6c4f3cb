<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Caleb Orr is a seasoned political and legal professional with significant experience in conservative advocacy and public service. He has held prominent roles, including serving as the Legislative Director for Senator Rand Paul, where he was instrumental in shaping policy, particularly around issues of deregulation and government reform. Orr is also an alumnus of the Hertog Foundation, where he engaged deeply with conservative political theory, and a fellow of the James Wilson Institute, which focuses on restoring America’s foundational legal principles. His background highlights a strong alignment with conservative principles and policy-making processes.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Orr’s career has placed him in close proximity to key figures and initiatives that align with Donald Trump’s agenda. His work with Senator Rand Paul connects him to a network of Trump allies who have supported the former president’s policies. Moreover, Orr’s involvement in Project 2025 further ties him to efforts that seek to expand upon Trump-era policies, particularly in the areas of deregulation, judicial appointments, and the consolidation of executive power.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Caleb Orr has not been involved in any personal scandals. However, his association with Project 2025 has drawn criticism due to the project’s ambitious goals of reshaping federal governance. Critics argue that the project’s proposals, which include significant deregulation and a shift towards more centralized executive authority, could pave the way for authoritarian governance. This controversy is closely tied to concerns about the project’s alignment with Trump’s approach to leadership, which has been a polarizing topic.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Orr’s role in Project 2025 raises potential concerns about the long-term impact of the policies he supports. The project’s focus on dismantling the administrative state and centralizing power has led to fears that it could undermine democratic institutions and checks and balances within the U.S. government. The project’s connection to Trump-era governance further intensifies these concerns, as it may perpetuate or even expand policies that critics view as authoritarian.</p>
