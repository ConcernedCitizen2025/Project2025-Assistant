His work at the Reason Foundation, however, is often at the center of public debates regarding the role of privatization in public infrastructure. The foundationâ€™s advocacy for reduced government involvement and increased private sector participation in infrastructure projects is sometimes criticized for prioritizing profit over public interest, potentially leading to reduced accessibility and equity in transportation services.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Feigenbaumâ€™s advocacy for privatization and market-based solutions in transportation can be controversial. Critics argue that such policies may prioritize profit over public interest, potentially leading to reduced accessibility and equity in transportation services.
