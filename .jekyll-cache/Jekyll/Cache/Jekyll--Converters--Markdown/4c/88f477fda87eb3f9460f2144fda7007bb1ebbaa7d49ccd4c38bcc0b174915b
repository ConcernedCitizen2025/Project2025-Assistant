The organization operates under The 85 Fund, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization (<a href="https://www.honestelections.org">Honest Elections Project</a>, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Honest_Elections_Project">Ballotpedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>HEP has notable connections to the Trump administration, particularly through its advocacy for policies that were prominent during Trumpâ€™s presidency. The organizationâ€™s focus on voter ID laws, opposition to mail-in voting expansions, and emphasis on auditing election results align closely with the rhetoric and policies promoted by Trump and his affiliates (<a href="https://www.honestelections.org">Honest Elections Project</a>, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Honest_Elections_Project">Ballotpedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Bias and Controversy:</strong> HEP has been criticized for promoting policies that could suppress voter turnout among minority and low-income populations. Its strong stance against mail-in voting and the use of private funds for election administration has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that these measures could disenfranchise legitimate voters (<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Honest_Elections_Project">Ballotpedia</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Honest Elections Project is a significant player in the conservative movement to reform election laws and ensure voting integrity. Its efforts, aligned with the broader agenda of the Trump administration, emphasize stringent voting requirements and robust election audits. However, its controversial stances and potential impacts on voter accessibility highlight the need for balanced scrutiny of its advocacy and policy proposals (<a href="https://www.honestelections.org">Honest Elections Project</a>, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Honest_Elections_Project">Ballotpedia</a>).</p>
