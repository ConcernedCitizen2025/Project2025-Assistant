<p><strong>Position:</strong> President, Institute for Energy Research (IER)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Thomas Pyle is the President of the Institute for Energy Research (IER), an organization dedicated to research and advocacy on energy markets and policy. Pyle has a background in energy policy and has worked in various roles that promote free-market energy solutions. He is known for his strong opposition to government intervention in energy markets, advocating for an “all of the above” approach that emphasizes the use of fossil fuels, including oil, natural gas, and coal.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Thomas Pyle has a notable connection to Donald Trump, having served as the head of Trump’s Department of Energy transition team in 2016. His role involved advising on energy policy and helping to shape the administration’s approach to energy issues, which included significant deregulation efforts and support for fossil fuel industries. Additionally, Pyle and the IER have been involved in promoting policies that align with Trump’s “America First” energy strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Pyle and the Institute for Energy Research have faced criticism for their strong ties to the fossil fuel industry and for their opposition to renewable energy policies. Critics argue that Pyle’s advocacy for deregulation and fossil fuel use could contribute to environmental degradation and climate change. However, these controversies are largely centered on policy disagreements rather than personal scandals.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Given Pyle’s influence in shaping energy policy under Trump and his ongoing advocacy through the IER, there are concerns among environmentalists and clean energy advocates about the potential impact of his work on future energy policies. His strong stance against renewable energy subsidies and support for fossil fuels are particularly contentious.</p>
