His work at IRLI continues to reflect these priorities, focusing on investigating and challenging practices and policies that are seen as undermining strict immigration enforcement. O’Brien’s efforts during and after the Trump administration underscore his commitment to advancing the administration’s hardline stance on immigration.</p>
