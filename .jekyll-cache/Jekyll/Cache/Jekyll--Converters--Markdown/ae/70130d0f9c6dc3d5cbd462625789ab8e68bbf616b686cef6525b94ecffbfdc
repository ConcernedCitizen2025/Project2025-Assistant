<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
David A. Deptula is a retired Lieutenant General in the U.S. Air Force, with over 34 years of service. He played a significant role in key military operations, including serving as the principal air campaign planner for Operation Desert Storm and leading ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) strategy development for the Air Force. He retired in 2010 as the first Deputy Chief of Staff for ISR at the Air Force Headquarters. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in astronomy and a Master of Science in systems engineering from the University of Virginia, and a Master of Science in national security strategy from the National War College.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
While Deptula did not hold an official position in the Trump administration, his work at the Mitchell Institute and his influence on defense policy discussions often align with the strategic objectives prominent during the Trump era. He has been a key voice in advocating for strong national defense policies that resonated with the administrationâ€™s approach.</p>

<p><strong>Controversies:</strong><br />
Following his retirement, Deptula was debarred by the Air Force General Counsel from conducting business with the Pentagon until 2016. This decision was related to allegations that he violated post-retirement lobbying restrictions concerning an airship project he supported during his time in the ISR office. Despite this setback, Deptula has remained an influential figure in defense and aerospace policy.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Deptulaâ€™s influence in military and defense strategy, especially through his role at the Mitchell Institute, positions him as a significant figure in shaping U.S. defense policy. His past controversies may raise concerns about the influence of retired military officials on active defense contracts and lobbying activities.</p>
