<p>The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a libertarian think tank founded in 1984 by Fred L. Smith Jr., based in Washington, D.C. The institute promotes limited government, free enterprise, and individual liberty, with a particular focus on regulatory policy, energy, and environmental issues. CEI is known for its opposition to government regulations, particularly those related to climate change, which it argues hinder innovation and economic growth.</p>
