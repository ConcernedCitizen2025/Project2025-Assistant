<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Independent Women‚Äôs Forum (IWF) is a conservative non-profit organization founded in 1992. Initially established in response to the Supreme Court nomination of Clarence Thomas, IWF has positioned itself as a counter to mainstream feminist organizations. The group advocates for policies emphasizing economic liberty, personal responsibility, and limited government intervention. Over the years, IWF has grown significantly, becoming a prominent voice in conservative circles, particularly on issues related to women‚Äôs rights, healthcare, and education.</p>
