While there isn’t a direct link between Nabil and Trump, the NTU’s support for policies that resonate with Trump’s “America First” economic agenda connects them in broader ideological terms. Additionally, Nabil’s involvement in Project 2025, which aims to shape the policy landscape for a future conservative administration, reflects an ongoing effort to influence post-Trump conservative policy.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
