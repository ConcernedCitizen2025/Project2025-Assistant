<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Amalia Halikiasâ€™s role at The Heritage Foundation involves areas of policy research that align with Donald Trumpâ€™s agenda, particularly in economic and social policies. The Heritage Foundationâ€™s Project 2025, a key initiative aimed at preparing for a potential future conservative administration, is closely aligned with the priorities that were central to the Trump administration.

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Halikiasâ€™s advocacy for conservative values and policies can be contentious. Critics may argue that her positions on social and economic issues could marginalize progressive viewpoints and the needs of disadvantaged groups. Her work often involves challenging progressive policy frameworks, attracting significant opposition from those who advocate for more inclusive policies.</p>
