<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> George Gibbs Chair in Political Economy and Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center, George Mason University</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Veronique de Rugy is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where her primary research interests include the U.S. economy, federal budget, taxation, tax competition, and cronyism. She writes a weekly opinion column for the Creators Syndicate, regular columns for Reason magazine, and blogs about economics at National Review Onlineâ€™s <em>The Corner</em>. De Rugy received her MA in economics from Paris Dauphine University and her PhD in economics from PanthÃ©on-Sorbonne University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
De Rugy has not held an official position in the Trump administration. However, her association with the Mercatus Center, a think tank known for its libertarian and free-market advocacy, aligns her research and policy recommendations with conservative and Trump-aligned economic ideologies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
De Rugyâ€™s vocal criticism of government spending and crony capitalism has sparked debate within policy circles. Her opposition to the Export-Import Bank has been particularly contentious, with critics arguing that her stance could undermine U.S. businessesâ€™ competitiveness internationally. However, no major personal scandals or controversies have been associated with her.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
In Project 2025, de Rugyâ€™s work likely involves advocating for significant changes in economic policy, particularly focusing on reducing federal spending and opposing crony capitalism. Her strong stance against the Export-Import Bank, which she argues serves as a form of corporate welfare, could be controversial among proponents of government-backed financial support for businesses.</p>
