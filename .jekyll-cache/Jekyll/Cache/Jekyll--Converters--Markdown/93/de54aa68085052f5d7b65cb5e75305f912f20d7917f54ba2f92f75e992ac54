<p><strong>Position:</strong> Director of the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Paul Ray is the Director of the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation. Prior to this, he served as the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) under President Donald Trump. In this role, Ray played a crucial part in advancing the Trump administration’s deregulatory agenda, overseeing significant rollbacks of federal regulations. His work focused on reducing the regulatory burden on businesses and encouraging economic growth through deregulation.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Paul Ray’s connection to Donald Trump is substantial due to his role as the head of OIRA during Trump’s presidency. He was directly involved in implementing policies that aligned with Trump’s goals of deregulation and reducing government oversight. Currently, at The Heritage Foundation, Ray contributes to Project 2025, an initiative designed to prepare for a potential conservative administration in 2025. This project is heavily influenced by the policies and priorities established during Trump’s tenure.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
During his time at OIRA, Paul Ray’s efforts in deregulation were met with criticism, particularly from environmental and consumer advocacy groups who argued that the rollbacks could harm public health and safety. However, no personal scandals or controversies have been directly associated with Ray.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Paul Ray’s significant role in the Trump administration’s deregulatory efforts and his current work with The Heritage Foundation on Project 2025 may raise concerns among those who view deregulation as potentially detrimental to public welfare. His involvement in shaping the policy framework for a future conservative administration could influence the continuation of similar deregulatory policies.</p>
