<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Policy Analyst at the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Andrew Gillen is a Senior Policy Analyst at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank that promotes free-market principles and limited government. His work primarily focuses on higher education policy, including issues related to college affordability, student debt, and education reform. Gillen holds a PhD in Economics from Florida State University and has previously worked with other policy research organizations such as the American Council of Trustees and Alumni and the Center for College Affordability and Productivity.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
While Andrew Gillen did not hold a formal position in the Trump administration, his policy positions on reducing government intervention and promoting free-market solutions in education align with the broader goals of the Trump administration. The Texas Public Policy Foundation, where Gillen works, has been influential in conservative circles, and its education policy recommendations are in line with the Trump administrationâ€™s focus on deregulation and educational choice. Additionally, in a potential second term, Trump has shown interest in more aggressive reforms in higher education, which could further align with Gillenâ€™s advocacy for reducing government involvement in education.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Andrew Gillen has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his work at the Texas Public Policy Foundation involves advocating for education policies that are subject to public and political debate. His positions on higher education reform, particularly around reducing federal financial aid and government involvement, have been controversial, especially among those who support more government intervention in education.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Gillenâ€™s advocacy for education reform, particularly his focus on reducing government involvement and promoting market-based solutions, can be contentious. Critics may argue that such positions could undermine public education and access to higher education for low-income students. Debates over the role of government in education, student loan policies, and funding for public universities are often highly polarized.</p>
