<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Karen Kerrigan’s advocacy work has intersected with the Trump administration’s economic policies. The SBE Council, under her leadership, supported several of Trump’s initiatives aimed at reducing regulations and taxes for small businesses.

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Karen Kerrigan has not been involved in any major scandals or controversies. Her professional career has been marked by consistent advocacy for small businesses and economic policies. However, her strong support for deregulation and tax cuts has occasionally been criticized by opponents who argue that such policies disproportionately benefit larger corporations and the wealthy, potentially at the expense of regulatory oversight and social equity.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
As a prominent voice in small business advocacy, Kerrigan’s support for deregulation and tax cuts aligns with pro-business policies. While these stances are beneficial for business growth, they may raise concerns about the broader implications for regulatory oversight, labor rights, and income inequality. Her close alignment with business interests might also prompt scrutiny regarding her positions on environmental regulations and her stance on “big-tech” measures that she argues could harm innovation and small businesses.</p>
