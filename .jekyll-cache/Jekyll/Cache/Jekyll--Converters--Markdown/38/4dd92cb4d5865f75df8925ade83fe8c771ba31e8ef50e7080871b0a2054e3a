<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Policy Director for Life at the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Brent Bennett is the Policy Director for Life:Powered, an initiative of the Texas Public Policy Foundation focused on raising Americaâ€™s energy IQ and promoting the benefits of fossil fuels. He holds a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin and a BA in Physics from the University of Tulsa. Prior to joining TPPF, Bennett worked as an energy policy analyst and for a startup involved in carbon nanotube technology for energy storage. His work at Life:Powered involves extensive engagement with policymakers and energy experts to advocate for the economic benefits of fossil fuels.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Although Brent Bennett did not serve directly in the Trump administration, his work at TPPF, particularly through the Life:Powered initiative, aligns with the Trump administrationâ€™s energy policies, which prioritized deregulation and the expansion of fossil fuel production. His advocacy efforts support the broader conservative agenda, including those endorsed by Trump, such as energy independence and economic growth through fossil fuel development. TPPFâ€™s involvement in Project 2025 further connects Bennett to initiatives aiming to prepare for a potential future conservative administration.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fossil Fuel Advocacy:</strong> Bennettâ€™s strong advocacy for fossil fuels has sparked controversy, especially among environmental groups and advocates for renewable energy. Critics argue that his promotion of fossil fuels hinders progress toward sustainable energy solutions and exacerbates climate change. Despite the pushback, Bennett continues to emphasize the economic advantages of fossil fuels, often at the expense of long-term environmental and health considerations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Bennettâ€™s role in promoting fossil fuels and his involvement in Project 2025 could raise concerns about the environmental impact of such policies. His stance on energy policy may be seen as regressive by those advocating for a transition to renewable energy, potentially leading to increased scrutiny as Project 2025 progresses.</p>
