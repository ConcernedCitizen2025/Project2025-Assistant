<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Rachel Greszler has not been involved in any major personal scandals. Her policy positions, particularly her strong advocacy for conservative economic principles, often generate debate and can be polarizing, especially among those who support more progressive economic policies.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Greszler’s advocacy for reducing government spending and promoting conservative economic reforms may be seen as favoring businesses and higher-income individuals while potentially neglecting the needs of lower-income workers. Her positions on Social Security and labor policies are often contentious, especially in discussions about economic inequality and public welfare programs.</p>
