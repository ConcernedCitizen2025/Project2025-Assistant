<p><strong>Role:</strong> Contributor</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Jay Kingham Senior Research Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs, The Heritage Foundation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Brett D. Schaefer is the Jay Kingham Senior Research Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs at The Heritage Foundationâ€™s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom. He has extensive experience analyzing foreign policy, particularly in relation to the United Nations and other international organizations. Schaefer has been with The Heritage Foundation since 1995 and has been a prominent voice in conservative circles, particularly on issues of U.S. sovereignty, international law, and the effectiveness of international institutions. His work includes editing and contributing to the book <em>ConUNdrum: The Limits of the United Nations and the Search for Alternatives</em>, which critically examines the role of the U.N.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Schaeferâ€™s contributions to Project 2025 align with many of the foreign policy and regulatory goals of the Trump administration, particularly the emphasis on limiting the influence of international organizations over U.S. sovereignty. His work reflects the broader conservative effort to reduce the U.S.â€™s commitments to global governance frameworks, a priority during Trumpâ€™s tenure.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
While Brett Schaefer himself has not been involved in significant scandals, his work, particularly within the context of Project 2025, has been part of the broader controversy surrounding the projectâ€™s goals. Project 2025 has been criticized for its aggressive plans to dismantle key federal agencies and reduce the influence of international bodies, which many see as a move toward greater isolationism and authoritarianism.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Schaeferâ€™s strong stance on reducing U.S. engagement with international organizations could potentially undermine global cooperation efforts. Critics argue that such a strategy might weaken the U.S.â€™s ability to influence international norms and could lead to increased global instability.</p>
