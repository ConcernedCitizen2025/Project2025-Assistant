<p><strong>Position:</strong> Deputy Director, Center for Energy and Environment, and Senior Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Daren Bakst is currently a Senior Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, where he focuses on environmental and agricultural issues. Before joining CEI, he was a Senior Research Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, where he launched a new energy and environmental center. He has also been involved with organizations like the Federalist Society, American Agricultural Law Association, and the Food and Drug Law Institute.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Bakstâ€™s affiliation with The Heritage Foundation, a significant influencer of the Trump administrationâ€™s policies, aligns his work with Trumpâ€™s deregulatory agenda, particularly in environmental and agricultural sectors. His contributions to Project 2025, where he authored key sections on agricultural policy, further connect him to ongoing efforts to advance Trump-aligned initiatives.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
While not involved in major scandals, Bakstâ€™s critical stance on climate policies and support for deregulation have sparked debates within the environmental policy community. His positions often align with those who oppose stringent environmental regulations, potentially leading to controversies regarding environmental protection. His advocacy for reducing government support for renewable energy and opposing greenhouse gas reduction efforts has drawn significant criticism from environmental advocates.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Bakstâ€™s work in Project 2025 emphasizes reducing federal regulations on agriculture and promoting free-market environmental policies. His stance includes critical views on climate change policies and regulatory barriers, which could lead to debates about the sustainability and environmental impacts of such deregulation. Critics argue that these positions could undermine efforts to combat climate change and protect natural resources, while supporters believe they are necessary to promote economic growth and reduce government overreach.</p>
