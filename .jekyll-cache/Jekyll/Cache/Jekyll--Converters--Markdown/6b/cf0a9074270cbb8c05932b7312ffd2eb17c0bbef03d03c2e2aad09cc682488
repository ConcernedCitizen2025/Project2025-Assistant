<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Claremont Institute, founded in 1979 by students of political theorist Harry V. Jaffa, is a conservative think tank based in Upland, California. The institute’s mission is to restore the principles of the American Founding to their rightful preeminent authority in national life. It focuses on teaching and promoting the philosophical foundations of limited government, statesmanship, natural rights, and the Constitution. The institute has gained significant influence in the conservative movement, particularly through its involvement in contemporary political and legal debates.</p>

<h2 id="mission-and-activities">Mission and Activities</h2>
<p>The Claremont Institute’s mission revolves around education, writing, and litigation to promote its conservative principles. Key activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Education:</strong> The institute runs several fellowship programs, including the Publius, Lincoln, John Marshall, and Speechwriters Fellowships, to train future conservative leaders in politics, law, media, and academia. These programs are central to its strategy of influencing the next generation of conservative thinkers and policymakers.</li>
  <li><strong>Publications:</strong> It publishes the <em>Claremont Review of Books</em> and <em>The American Mind</em>, which engage with policy at the level of ideas and promote conservative thought. These publications have become important platforms for advancing the institute’s ideological perspectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Litigation:</strong> Through the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, the institute engages in strategic constitutional litigation, filing briefs that advocate for the principles of the American Founding, often aligning with conservative legal interpretations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leadership-and-influence">Leadership and Influence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/11/claremont-institute-society-for-american-civic-renewal-links">Ryan Williams</a>:</strong> President of the Claremont Institute since 2017, Williams has directed the organization’s focus on contemporary conservative issues, particularly those aligned with Trump-era policies. His leadership has solidified Claremont’s position as a significant intellectual force in the conservative movement.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://statesunited.org/resources/the-final-case/">John Eastman</a>:</strong> Senior Fellow and founding director of the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence at Claremont, Eastman played a controversial role in advising former President Donald Trump during the 2020 election disputes. His legal theories about rejecting Electoral College votes have been highly scrutinized, contributing to efforts to overturn the election results, which has led to widespread criticism and legal challenges.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>
<p>The Claremont Institute has been a strong supporter of Donald Trump, particularly in defending his policies and actions related to the 2020 election. The institute’s influence grew during Trump’s presidency, with several of its fellows, like John Eastman, playing central roles in the administration’s legal strategies. Claremont’s involvement in supporting Trump’s election challenges, including the controversial efforts led by Eastman, highlights its significant impact on Trump-era conservatism.</p>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Support for Election Disputes:</strong> The Claremont Institute’s backing of efforts to challenge the 2020 election results, particularly through John Eastman’s controversial legal advice, poses risks to the integrity of democratic processes. This involvement suggests a willingness to engage in strategies that may undermine public trust in electoral outcomes and democratic institutions.</li>
  <li><strong>Ideological Shift:</strong> Under Trump’s influence, the Claremont Institute has shifted towards a more aggressive form of conservatism that some critics argue is at odds with its original mission of promoting the Founders’ principles. This shift has sparked debate within the conservative movement about the direction and legacy of the institute.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Claremont Institute is a significant force in the conservative movement, promoting a return to what it views as the true principles of the American Founding. While its educational and publishing efforts contribute to conservative intellectual discourse, its controversial involvement in the 2020 election disputes raises critical questions about its impact on American democracy. Ongoing scrutiny of its activities and affiliations is essential to understand the broader implications of its influence.</p>
