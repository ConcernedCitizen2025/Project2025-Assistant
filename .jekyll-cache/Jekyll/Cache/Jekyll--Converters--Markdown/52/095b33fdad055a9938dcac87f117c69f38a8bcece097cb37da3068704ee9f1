<p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Chief of Staff and Acting Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Anthony Campau served as Chief of Staff and Acting Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during the Trump administration. OIRA plays a crucial role in reviewing federal regulations and ensuring that new regulations align with the administration’s policy objectives. Before joining the Trump administration, Campau held various roles at The Heritage Foundation and in the legal sector, focusing on regulatory and policy matters. He holds a JD and an LL.M. in Securities and Financial Regulation from Georgetown University Law Center.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Campau’s work at OIRA was directly aligned with the Trump administration’s deregulatory agenda, which aimed to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses and stimulate economic growth. His role involved overseeing the implementation of key regulatory changes, such as the “two-for-one” executive order, which required agencies to eliminate two existing regulations for every new one enacted. Campau also contributed to regulatory budgeting efforts, setting cost ceilings for agencies’ annual regulatory output, which was a significant component of Trump’s regulatory reform efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deregulatory Agenda:</strong> Campau’s work at OIRA was part of the broader and often controversial deregulatory push by the Trump administration. Critics argued that this agenda prioritized economic benefits over public health, safety, and environmental protections. The “two-for-one” rule and regulatory budget mandates, in particular, were criticized for forcing agencies to make decisions based on cost-cutting rather than the merits of the regulations themselves.</li>
  <li><strong>OIRA’s Expanded Role:</strong> The expansion of OIRA’s role under the Trump administration, with new requirements like “cut-go” and regulatory budgeting, faced legal challenges and was criticized for overstepping traditional boundaries in regulatory oversight, potentially violating administrative law principles.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Campau’s involvement in the Trump administration’s aggressive deregulation strategy has been contentious. While his actions were praised by those in favor of reducing regulatory burdens, they were heavily criticized by public health and environmental advocates who argued that these policies weakened essential protections.</p>
