<p><strong>Position:</strong> Project 2025 Contributor, Former Trump Administration Official</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Brett Swearingen has been involved in conservative policy-making, particularly through his contributions to Project 2025. Although specific details about his previous roles are not widely publicized, Swearingen is noted for his work alongside other former Trump administration officials in shaping the policy frameworks within Project 2025. This initiative is aimed at restructuring the federal government under a future Republican administration, with a strong emphasis on consolidating executive power.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Swearingenâ€™s role in Project 2025 places him within a network of former Trump officials and allies who are working to ensure that the policies and approaches favored by the Trump administration are ready to be implemented should Trump or another Republican win the presidency in 2024. Project 2025 has been seen as a blueprint for a potential second Trump term, making Swearingenâ€™s contributions directly relevant to Trumpâ€™s future plans.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Project 2025 itself has been a subject of controversy, particularly for its ambitious plans to overhaul the federal government and its potential implications for U.S. democracy. Critics have raised concerns about the projectâ€™s intent to replace civil servants with political appointees loyal to conservative agendas, which some view as a move towards authoritarian governance. Swearingen, as part of this project, is associated with these controversial strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Swearingenâ€™s involvement in Project 2025 could be seen as problematic by those who fear that the projectâ€™s goals might undermine the independence of federal agencies and erode democratic norms. The emphasis on executive power and the replacement of career civil servants with politically aligned individuals are key issues that have drawn criticism.</p>
