<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Vice President of Policy at the American Energy Alliance (AEA)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Dan Kish is a seasoned energy policy expert with over 25 years of experience in natural resource and energy policy. He currently serves as the Senior Vice President of Policy at the American Energy Alliance (AEA), a leading organization advocating for free-market energy policies. Kish‚Äôs career has been marked by significant influence in shaping U.S. energy policy, particularly through his roles on key congressional committees.</p>

<p>Kish served as the Chief of Staff for the Republicans on the House Resources Committee, where he was involved in crafting and promoting legislation related to energy production, land use, and environmental policy. He also worked on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, contributing to the development of policies that supported domestic energy production, particularly in the fossil fuel sector. His experience on these committees has made him a pivotal figure in advancing conservative energy policies focused on deregulation and increased exploitation of natural resources.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Dan Kish has been closely aligned with the Trump administration‚Äôs energy agenda, which prioritized ‚Äúenergy dominance‚Äù through the expansion of fossil fuels and the rollback of environmental regulations. As a leading figure in Project 2025, a strategic initiative aimed at preparing for a potential future conservative administration, Kish has contributed to policy recommendations that would significantly reshape U.S. energy and environmental policy. These proposals include reducing the regulatory power of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Energy (DOE), and promoting fossil fuel industries over renewable energy sources.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Kish‚Äôs advocacy for fossil fuels and his opposition to climate change regulations have made him a controversial figure, particularly among environmental groups and climate advocates. His role in Project 2025 has drawn criticism for its potential to undermine environmental protections and prioritize industry interests over public health and climate change mitigation. The project‚Äôs extreme vision for the future of U.S. energy policy includes dismantling key regulatory frameworks that have been instrumental in addressing environmental challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Kish‚Äôs policy positions, particularly those advocating for the deregulation of environmental protections and the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure, raise significant concerns about the long-term impacts on climate change and environmental sustainability. Critics argue that the policies he supports could lead to increased carbon emissions, greater environmental degradation, and a failure to meet international climate commitments. His influence in shaping Project 2025‚Äôs energy policy underscores the potential for these concerns to become reality should these recommendations be implemented.</p>
