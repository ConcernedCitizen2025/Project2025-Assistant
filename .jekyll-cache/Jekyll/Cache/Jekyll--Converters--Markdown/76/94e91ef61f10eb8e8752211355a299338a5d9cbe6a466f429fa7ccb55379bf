<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The American Conservative (TAC) is a magazine founded in 2002 by Pat Buchanan, Scott McConnell, and Taki Theodoracopulos. It was established as a response to the growing dominance of neoconservative ideologies within the Republican Party, particularly regarding foreign policy and globalism. TAC promotes traditional conservative values, focusing on non-interventionism, civil liberties, and economic restraint. The publication positions itself as an alternative voice within the conservative movement, advocating for “Main Street conservatism” that emphasizes the importance of community, localism, and realism in foreign affairs (<a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com">The American Conservative</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<h2 id="connections-to-trump">Connections to Trump</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Bias:</strong> TAC is known for its strong conservative bias, particularly its opposition to neoconservative views within the GOP.
