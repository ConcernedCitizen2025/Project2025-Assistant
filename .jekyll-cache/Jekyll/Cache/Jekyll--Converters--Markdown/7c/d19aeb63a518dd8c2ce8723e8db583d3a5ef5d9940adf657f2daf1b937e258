<p><strong>Role:</strong> Author</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> Director of the Center for Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Lindsey M. Burke is the Director of the Center for Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation, where she oversees research and policy development on federal and state education issues, particularly around preschool, K-12, and higher education reform. Burke has been a prominent advocate for education choice options, such as education savings accounts (ESAs) and school vouchers. She served on Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkinâ€™s transition steering committee for education and holds various advisory roles, including on the Board of Visitors for George Mason University and the Educational Freedom Institute. Burke holds a BA from Hollins University, an MA from the University of Virginia, and a PhD in Education Policy from George Mason University.</p>

<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Burkeâ€™s work closely aligns with the conservative agenda championed by the Trump administration. Her association with The Heritage Foundationâ€”a key influencer of Trumpâ€™s policy decisionsâ€”underscores her connection to his political framework. She has supported initiatives that resonate with Trumpâ€™s educational priorities, particularly the push for school choice and reduced federal involvement in education.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
While Lindsey M. Burke has not been directly involved in any major scandals, her advocacy for conservative education reforms, such as the elimination of the federal Department of Education and the promotion of privatized education models, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that these policies could undermine public education and exacerbate educational inequality.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Burkeâ€™s strong focus on education reform through privatization and school choice could potentially impact public education systems negatively. Her association with organizations like the Independent Womenâ€™s Forum, which advocates for conservative womenâ€™s issues, further aligns her educational policies with broader conservative values. Additionally, her involvement in Project 2025â€”a strategic initiative to prepare for a conservative administration by 2025â€”emphasizes her commitment to drastically restructuring federal education policy.</p>
