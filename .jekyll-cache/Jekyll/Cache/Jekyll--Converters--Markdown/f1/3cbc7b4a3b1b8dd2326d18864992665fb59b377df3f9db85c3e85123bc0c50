<p><strong>Relation to Trump:</strong><br />
Joseph Edlowâ€™s role as Deputy Director for Policy at USCIS placed him at the center of the Trump administrationâ€™s efforts to overhaul U.S. immigration policy. His work involved implementing and promoting the administrationâ€™s immigration priorities, which included increased enforcement, stricter vetting processes, and efforts to reduce both legal and illegal immigration. His current role at The Heritage Foundation continues to support and advocate for similar immigration policies.</p>

<p><strong>Scandals or Controversies:</strong><br />
Joseph Edlow has not been involved in any major personal scandals. However, his work on immigration policy, particularly during his tenure at USCIS, has been subject to intense public and political scrutiny. The Trump administrationâ€™s immigration policies were highly controversial, leading to significant debate and criticism from various advocacy groups and political opponents. As a prominent figure in these efforts, Edlowâ€™s work has been part of these broader contentious discussions.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Concerns:</strong><br />
Edlowâ€™s work in immigration policy, both at USCIS and The Heritage Foundation, often involves advocating for stricter immigration controls and enforcement, which can be highly contentious. Critics argue that such policies can be exclusionary and may undermine the rights of immigrants. His positions on immigration reform and enforcement can attract significant debate and opposition from immigration advocates and progressive groups.</p>
