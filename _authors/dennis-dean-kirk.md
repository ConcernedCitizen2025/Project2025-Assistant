# Dennis Dean Kirk

**Role:** Author

**Position:** Chairman of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA)

**Background:**  
Dennis Dean Kirk serves as the Chairman of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), a position he was appointed to by President Donald Trump in 2017. The FLRA is responsible for administering labor-management relations for non-postal federal employees. Kirk has a background in labor law and has held various positions within the federal government, including roles at the U.S. Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board. He is also the Associate Director for Personnel Policy with the 2025 Presidential Transition Project at The Heritage Foundation.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Kirk was nominated by Trump in 2018 to serve as Chairman of the Merit Systems Protection Board, but he was never confirmed, leading to operational delays and a backlog of complaints. His eventual appointment as Chairman of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) by Trump underscores his connection to the administration. His work at the FLRA aligns with Trump's approach to federal labor relations, focusing on efficiency and reducing union influence. His role in Project 2025 further connects him to Trump's vision for reforming federal labor policies.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Dennis Dean Kirk has been involved in controversies primarily related to his role at the FLRA. His tenure has seen significant pushback from federal employee unions and labor advocates who argue that his policies undermine workers' rights and the collective bargaining process. The FLRA under Kirk reversed decades of precedent, leading to lawsuits and court rulings that struck down some of the Trump-era policies as overreaching and harmful to labor relations.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Kirk's leadership at the FLRA has been marked by efforts to streamline labor relations processes and reduce the influence of federal employee unions. His policies and decisions have sometimes been viewed as favoring management over labor, raising concerns among union advocates and employees about the potential erosion of labor rights and protections. Critics fear that his involvement in Project 2025 could lead to further weakening of federal unions and a shift towards policies that prioritize efficiency over employee rights.
