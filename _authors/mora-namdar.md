**Role:** Author

**Position:** Former Acting Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State

**Background:**  
Mora Namdar served as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs at the U.S. Department of State during the Trump administration. She held various other roles within the State Department, including Deputy Assistant Secretary for Overseas Citizens Services and Senior Advisor in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs. Namdar holds a JD from Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law and a BA from the University of Texas at Austin.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Namdar served as Acting Assistant Secretary of State from December 2020 to January 2021 and as a policy adviser in the State Department from 2019. Her senior roles during the Trump administration involved implementing policies aligned with Trump's immigration and foreign policy goals, including overseeing visa services and the protection of U.S. citizens abroad.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Mora Namdar has not been involved in any major scandals or controversies. However, her role in overseeing consular services during the Trump administration's implementation of controversial policies, such as the travel ban affecting several predominantly Muslim countries, has drawn scrutiny. These policies faced significant public and legal challenges, which brought attention to the State Departmentâ€™s handling of consular affairs under her leadership.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Namdar's tenure coincided with significant policy shifts regarding immigration and travel bans. Her role in executing these policies could raise concerns about their impact on international relations and humanitarian considerations. Additionally, her involvement in Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation initiative that outlines conservative strategies for a potential future administration, might influence future foreign policy and consular operations.
