# Jonathan Berry

**Role:** Author

**Position:** Managing Partner at Boyden Gray & Associates PLLC

**Background:**  
Jonathan Berry is the Managing Partner at Boyden Gray & Associates PLLC, where he provides strategic counsel on issues at the intersection of law, politics, and public policy. Berry has a robust background in government service, having served as Acting Assistant Secretary for Policy at the U.S. Department of Labor during the Trump administration. He was instrumental in overseeing regulatory policy and played a key role in the nominations of Justice Neil Gorsuch and other federal judges. Before his time at the Department of Labor, Berry was Chief Counsel for the Trump transition team and clerked for Justice Samuel Alito and Judge Jerry Smith of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. He is a graduate of Yale College and Columbia University School of Law.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Berry served as Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice from 2017 to 2018 and was a member of Trump's presidential transition team in 2016 and 2017, focusing on ethics and legal policy. His roles in the DOJ and during the transition reflect his deep involvement in shaping Trump's judicial and regulatory policies. Berry's contributions to Project 2025, where he co-authored sections on labor, further demonstrate his alignment with Trump's priorities, advocating for significant changes to labor laws consistent with the administrationâ€™s goals.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Jonathan Berry has not been directly involved in any major scandals. However, his work on regulatory policy and judicial nominations during the Trump administration has been politically charged. His involvement in the development of policies through Project 2025, which some critics argue could potentially roll back worker protections, has also been subject to scrutiny.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Berry's involvement in Project 2025, particularly his advocacy for changes in labor and regulatory policies, reflects a conservative approach that could lead to significant shifts in how labor laws are applied. This includes adjustments to overtime pay rules, which have been debated as potentially reducing worker protections, despite Berry's assertions that the changes would benefit both workers and employers.
