Before this role, he was the executive director of Trump's presidential transition team and Chief of Staff to then-Senator Jeff Sessions. He has extensive experience in legislative and intergovernmental affairs, having worked with several Senate committees and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Currently, Dearborn is a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, where he contributes to Project 2025, an initiative focused on preparing a conservative policy framework and staffing plan for the next presidential administration.

**Scandals or Controversies:**

- **House Judiciary Committee Subpoena:** Dearborn was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee as part of broader investigations related to the Trump administration. This was part of the committee's efforts to probe potential misconduct, though Dearborn did not face significant legal repercussions.
