# Max Primorac

**Role:** Author

**Position:** Former Senior Advisor to the Administrator at USAID and Acting Assistant Administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)

**Background:**  
Max Primorac served in several senior roles at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) during the Trump administration, including as Senior Advisor to the Administrator and Acting Assistant Administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). He has a strong background in international development and humanitarian assistance, with experience spanning various capacities in the U.S. government and international organizations. Primorac holds a BA from the University of Dayton and an MA from American University.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Max Primorac served as the Acting Chief Operating Officer for USAID from November 2020 to January 2021 and had previously worked as an adviser at the agency since 2018. His tenure at USAID was closely aligned with the Trump administration’s foreign aid policies, which emphasized aid effectiveness and alignment with U.S. strategic interests. Primorac's involvement in Project 2025, an initiative preparing for a potential future conservative administration, further connects him to Trump’s political network, reflecting his ongoing influence within conservative circles.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
While Primorac himself has not been directly involved in major personal scandals, his tenure at USAID and involvement in Project 2025 have been surrounded by controversy. Critics argue that the policy shifts he supported could undermine long-term development goals and the impartiality of humanitarian aid. Additionally, leaked videos from Project 2025 reveal strategies for dismantling existing government structures and overcoming resistance from career bureaucrats, raising concerns about the potential politicization of federal agencies under future conservative administrations.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Primorac’s role in Project 2025 and his past positions reflect a focus on aligning U.S. foreign aid and development assistance with conservative priorities, which could lead to reduced emphasis on global humanitarian needs. His leadership in such initiatives has sparked debate about the direction of U.S. foreign aid, particularly the risk of it being used more as a political tool than a means of addressing global challenges.
