# Dustin J. Carmack

**Role:** Author

**Position:** Research Fellow for Cybersecurity Intelligence and Emerging Technologies at The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Dustin J. Carmack previously served in the Intelligence Community as Chief of Staff to the Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe. He has also been Chief of Staff to Congressman John Ratcliffe (TX-04) and Congressman Ron DeSantis (FL-06). His academic background includes studies at Truman State University in Missouri and Tel Aviv University in Israel.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Carmack served as Chief of Staff to the Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, from 2020 to 2021. His role placed him at the center of Trumpâ€™s intelligence community, strengthening his ties to the administration. His work with Congressman Ron DeSantis, a notable Trump ally, further connects him to Trump's political network. Carmack's involvement in Project 2025, particularly in cybersecurity and intelligence, aligns with the Trump administration's focus on national security and addressing foreign threats.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Carmack has not been directly involved in any major scandals. However, his tenure in the Trump administration's intelligence community, which faced scrutiny for its handling of intelligence related to election security and foreign interference, may raise concerns about potential biases and the integrity of his recommendations.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Carmack's involvement in Project 2025 includes advocating for significant changes in the intelligence community's regulatory and operational framework. His stance on cybersecurity and intelligence, particularly his focus on threats from countries like China and Russia, may reflect a continuation of the Trump administration's hardline policies. His recommendations could lead to increased surveillance measures and reduced privacy protections, which may be contentious among privacy advocates and civil liberties groups.
