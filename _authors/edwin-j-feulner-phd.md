# Edwin J. Feulner, PhD

## Background
Edwin J. Feulner, PhD, is a pivotal figure in the conservative movement, most notably as the founder and former long-time president of The Heritage Foundation, one of the most influential conservative think tanks in the United States. Born on August 12, 1941, in Chicago, Illinois, Feulner has significantly shaped American conservative policy over several decades. He has a PhD from the University of Edinburgh, an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and a BS from Regis University. Feulner has also studied at Georgetown University and the London School of Economics.

## Career Highlights
1. **The Heritage Foundation**: Feulner co-founded The Heritage Foundation in 1973 and served as its president from 1977 to 2013, and briefly again from 2017 to 2018. Under his leadership, Heritage grew from a small think tank into a major force in American politics, often described as the "Parthenon of the conservative metropolis." Feulner implemented the "briefcase test" strategy, emphasizing timely and impactful policy studies that were aggressively marketed to lawmakers and the media.

2. **Policy Influence**: Feulner’s approach to making policy studies actionable helped Heritage become a model for other think tanks. His influence extended to several presidential administrations, where Heritage's policy recommendations were often adopted, particularly during the Reagan and Trump administrations.

3. **Roles in Government and Advisory Positions**: Feulner served as a consultant on domestic policy to President Ronald Reagan and held numerous advisory roles, including Vice Chairman of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform (Kemp Commission) and Chairman of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy. He has also served on several influential task forces and advisory boards.

4. **Awards and Honors**: Among his numerous accolades, Feulner received the Presidential Citizens Medal from Ronald Reagan in 1989 and the Bradley Prize in 2012. He has also been recognized by various international governments and featured in lists of the most influential conservatives in America.

## Potential Concerns
Feulner's tenure at The Heritage Foundation has not been without controversy:

1. **Ideological Rigidness**: Critics argue that under Feulner, the Heritage Foundation has sometimes adopted an overly rigid ideological stance, potentially alienating moderate voices within the conservative movement.

2. **Political Partisanship**: Although The Heritage Foundation is a non-partisan organization, its close alignment with conservative and Republican agendas, especially during Feulner’s leadership, has led to criticisms of political partisanship.

## Relation to Trump
While Feulner himself was not directly involved in the Trump administration, The Heritage Foundation under his leadership played a crucial role in shaping Trump’s policy agenda. Heritage provided numerous policy recommendations and personnel to the Trump administration, significantly influencing its conservative policy directions.

## Scandals or Controversies
Feulner has maintained a reputation free of personal scandals. However, his leadership at The Heritage Foundation, particularly the emphasis on strong conservative policies, has occasionally sparked debates within political and academic circles.
