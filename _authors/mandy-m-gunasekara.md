# Mandy M. Gunasekara

**Role:** Author

**Position:** Principal at Section VII Strategies, Senior Policy Analyst at the Independent Women's Forum, Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation

**Background:**  
Mandy M. Gunasekara served as the Chief of Staff at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and as Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation during the Trump administration. She played a key role in rolling back pollution controls and other environmental regulations. Gunasekara has also worked as Majority Counsel for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee under Chairman Jim Inhofe. In addition to her work in the Trump administration, she founded the Energy 45 Fund to promote Trump's energy policies.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Gunasekara served as Chief of Staff at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 2020 to 2021, having previously worked as a Senior Policy Adviser since 2017. She is a strong proponent of Trump's environmental policies and played a significant role in crafting the Project 2025 vision for downsizing the EPA and overhauling regulations set by President Joe Biden. The blueprint she helped draft recommends eliminating certain offices, relocating regional offices, resetting advisory boards, and reviewing existing regulations and grants. Gunasekara supports the idea that Project 2025 is a strategic guide for future conservative administrations, with Trumpâ€™s distance from the project aligning with its role as a policy blueprint rather than an immediate agenda.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Gunasekara has been involved in several controversies, particularly related to her tenure at the EPA. She was a central figure in the rollback of multiple environmental protections, which garnered significant criticism from environmental groups. Furthermore, her recent disqualification from running for a Public Service Commission position in Mississippi due to not meeting the state's residency requirements has raised additional concerns about her political maneuvers.

**Potential Concerns:**  
In Project 2025, Gunasekara's focus is expected to be on energy and environmental policies, advocating for deregulation and promoting fossil fuel interests. Her approach, which includes rolling back pollution controls and opposing climate change regulations, continues to be a point of contention among environmentalists and policymakers who worry about the long-term impacts of such policies.
