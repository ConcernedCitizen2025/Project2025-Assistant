# Kevin D. Roberts, PhD

## Background
Kevin D. Roberts, PhD, is the President of The Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action for America. He took on the role of president of The Heritage Foundation in October 2021, succeeding Kay C. James. In September 2023, he was also named President of Heritage Action for America, the lobbying arm of The Heritage Foundation, thereby holding joint leadership roles in both organizations.

Roberts has a strong academic background, holding a PhD in American History from the University of Texas at Austin, a master's degree in History from Virginia Tech, and a bachelor's degree in History from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

## Career Highlights
1. **Educational Leadership**: In 2006, Roberts founded John Paul the Great Academy, a K-12 Catholic liberal arts school in Lafayette, Louisiana, where he served as president and headmaster for seven years. In 2013, he became the president of Wyoming Catholic College, where he led the institution to reject federal student loans and grants to preserve its religious liberty, earning the school the moniker "cowboy Catholics" from The New York Times.

2. **Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF)**: As CEO of TPPF, Roberts significantly expanded the organization's influence, both in Texas and nationwide, including opening an office in Washington, D.C. This move was aimed at influencing federal policy debates with TPPF's research.

3. **The Heritage Foundation**: Since becoming the president of The Heritage Foundation, Roberts has focused on various conservative issues, including education, health care, border security, and election integrity. His leadership is crucial in opposing what he describes as the radical, socialist agenda being advanced by the Left.

## Project 2025
Kevin D. Roberts is a key figure in Project 2025, an initiative aimed at preparing for a conservative administration by January 2025. This project involves detailed plans to reshape the federal government and consolidate executive power, drawing support and collaboration from more than 50 conservative organizations.

## Potential Concerns
Kevin Roberts' leadership and involvement in various conservative initiatives raise several concerns:

1. **Project 2025's Goals**: The project's aim to significantly reshape federal governance and consolidate executive power has been viewed critically by those concerned about the centralization of authority and potential undermining of democratic institutions.

2. **Heritage Foundation's Influence**: Under Roberts' leadership, The Heritage Foundation has been a driving force behind conservative policy proposals, which some critics argue could lead to the erosion of regulatory frameworks and social safety nets.

## Relation to Trump
In 2022, Trump flew on a private jet with Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, as reported by the Washington Post, and later spoke at a Heritage Foundation event where he praised Roberts for "doing an unbelievable job." Kevin D. Roberts has been a vocal supporter of Trumpism, advocating for the integration of its principles within The Heritage Foundation. He has played a role in shaping policy and political strategy that align with Trump's agenda, including promoting election integrity and border security policies that resonate with Trump's base.

## Scandals or Controversies
Roberts has not been directly involved in major scandals or controversies, but his leadership decisions have occasionally sparked debate:

1. **Rejection of Federal Funding**: As president of Wyoming Catholic College, his decision to reject federal student loans and grants was controversial, attracting both praise for maintaining religious principles and criticism for limiting financial aid options for students.

2. **Election Integrity Stance**: Roberts' stance on the 2020 election results, where he expressed doubt about Joe Biden's victory, aligns him with the broader "Stop the Steal" movement, which has been controversial and widely criticized.

3. **Controversial Book Title**: Roberts's upcoming book, initially titled *The Conservative Ascendancy: Burning Down Washington to Save America*, was revised to *Reclaiming the Right: Taking Back Washington to Save America*. The changes in the subtitle and cover design—removing the match symbol and softening promotional language—reflect a shift in response to growing scrutiny of the Trump campaign's connections to Project 2025. J.D. Vance, Trump's VP Candidate, wrote the foreword for Roberts' book, highlighting their collaborative efforts in advancing conservative principles.

Overall, Kevin D. Roberts is a prominent conservative leader whose actions and affiliations continue to shape significant policy debates and strategic directions within the conservative movement.
