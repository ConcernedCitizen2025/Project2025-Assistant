# Christopher Miller

**Role:** Author

**Position:** Former Acting Secretary of Defense

**Background:**  
Christopher Miller served as the Acting Secretary of Defense from November 9, 2020, to January 20, 2021, appointed by President Donald Trump. Prior to this role, he was the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center and held several positions within the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. Miller is a retired U.S. Army officer, having served in the Special Forces, and holds a BA from George Washington University and an MA from the Naval War College.

**Relation to Trump:**  
Miller served in three roles during the Trump administration within a span of seven months: Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense (June 2020), Director of the National Counterterrorism Center (August 2020), and Acting Secretary of Defense (November 2020 to January 2021). His appointments and leadership during a critical period reflect a close alignment with Trump's defense and national security agenda. His role in Project 2025 further connects him to ongoing efforts to advance Trump-aligned defense policies.

**Scandals or Controversies:**  
Christopher Miller has been involved in controversies primarily related to his actions as Acting Secretary of Defense. His role in the delayed response to the January 6 Capitol riot has been particularly contentious, with questions about the decision-making process and communication with other federal agencies. Critics have also questioned the rapid policy changes he implemented during his brief tenure, viewing them as potentially destabilizing.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Miller's short tenure as Acting Secretary of Defense was marked by significant changes in Pentagon leadership and policy directions. His actions during the final months of the Trump administration, including the drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, raised concerns about the stability and continuity of U.S. defense policy. Additionally, his involvement in the events surrounding the January 6 Capitol riot has been scrutinized, particularly regarding the timing and deployment of National Guard troops. His association with Project 2025 has also drawn criticism, as some view it as an effort to continue controversial policies from the Trump era.
