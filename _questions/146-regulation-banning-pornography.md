# **Regulation and Banning of Pornography in Project 2025**

#### **Introduction**

Pornography has long been a contentious issue in American society, with debates surrounding its impact on individuals, relationships, and the broader culture. Project 2025 takes a firm stance on the regulation and potential banning of pornography, reflecting broader conservative values and concerns about morality, public decency, and the influence of adult content on society. This analysis explores the specific measures proposed by Project 2025 regarding the regulation or banning of pornography, assessing the potential implications for the industry, access to adult content, and the broader impact on civil liberties and democratic values.

#### **Proposed Measures for Regulating Pornography**

Project 2025 advocates for stricter regulation of pornography, focusing on several key areas, including age verification, content restrictions, and increased penalties for illegal distribution (Project 2025, 2024, Federal Communications Commission). The plan emphasizes the need to protect minors from exposure to adult content, proposing more robust age verification requirements for accessing online pornography. This could involve mandating that websites implement stricter controls, such as government-issued ID checks, to ensure that only adults can access such material.

Additionally, Project 2025 supports enhanced content restrictions, particularly targeting material deemed to be excessively violent, degrading, or obscene. The plan suggests that certain types of adult content could be banned outright if they are found to violate community standards of decency. It also calls for increasing the penalties for those who produce, distribute, or profit from illegal pornography, including child exploitation material.

**Potential Concerns:**  
While these measures are presented as necessary steps to protect public morality and safeguard children, they raise significant concerns about censorship, privacy, and the potential overreach of government power. Stricter age verification processes could lead to privacy violations, as users may be required to provide sensitive personal information to access legal content. Additionally, the subjective nature of what constitutes "obscene" or "degrading" content could result in arbitrary or politically motivated censorship, potentially infringing on free speech rights. The increased penalties for illegal content distribution, while aimed at addressing serious crimes like child exploitation, could also have unintended consequences, such as discouraging the legitimate production and distribution of adult content that complies with existing laws.

#### **Banning Pornography**

Beyond regulation, Project 2025 hints at the possibility of outright banning certain types of pornography that are deemed particularly harmful to society (Project 2025, 2024, Department of Justice). The plan suggests that federal and state governments should have the authority to ban content that is seen as contributing to moral decay or undermining social values. This could involve legislation that defines and prohibits specific categories of pornography, with strict enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.

The far-right crusade against pornography, as highlighted by Project 2025, seems to be less about protecting public decency and more about controlling cultural narratives, particularly those that challenge traditional gender roles and norms. This is evident from the absence of a clear definition of what constitutes pornography in Project 2025, allowing for broad interpretations that could classify LGBTQ+ content or discussions on non-normative gender expressions as obscene and subject to censorship or even criminalization (Mahdawi, 2024).

**Potential Concerns:**  
The prospect of banning pornography raises serious concerns about government overreach and the erosion of civil liberties. Defining what constitutes harmful or immoral content is inherently subjective, and empowering the government to make these determinations could lead to the suppression of lawful expression. The broad authority to ban content could be used to target not only pornography but also other forms of media or expression that are deemed controversial or politically inconvenient. This could set a dangerous precedent for the regulation of free speech and the arts, with far-reaching implications for democratic values and individual freedoms.

#### **Impact on the Industry and Access to Adult Content**

The measures proposed in Project 2025 could have a profound impact on the pornography industry and access to adult content in the United States. Stricter regulations and the potential for bans could drive the industry underground, making it more difficult for consumers to access legal, regulated content. This could lead to an increase in unregulated or illegal distribution channels, potentially exposing users to greater risks, such as fraud, exploitation, or exposure to illegal material. The economic impact on the adult entertainment industry could also be significant, with potential job losses and financial strain on companies that produce and distribute adult content legally.

**Potential Concerns:**  
Pushing the industry underground could have unintended consequences, such as reducing the effectiveness of existing regulations designed to protect consumers and combat illegal activity. It could also make it more challenging to monitor and address issues like child exploitation, as enforcement agencies may be overwhelmed by the proliferation of illegal content. Additionally, the economic impact on the legal adult entertainment industry could extend to other sectors, such as technology and telecommunications, which rely on the revenue generated by online content.

#### **Criminalizing Librarians and Educators**

Project 2025 contains a particularly alarming proposal that suggests criminalizing educators and public librarians who are perceived to "purvey" pornography. The term "pornography" here is not clearly defined, leaving its interpretation dangerously broad. According to Project 2025, pornography has allegedly invaded children's school libraries, and it advocates that those responsible for distributing or making this material available should be charged as registered sex offenders (Project 2025, 2024, Department of Justice).

This approach to defining and regulating pornography is not about protecting public decency or morality, as Project 2025 claims. Instead, it appears to be a weaponized term used to target and suppress LGBTQ+ content and any media that challenges traditional gender roles or heteronormative standards. The Guardian article underscores how Project 2025 equates LGBTQ+ literature, discussions on non-normative gender identities, and even sex education with pornography, using this as a pretext to ban such content from public spaces, including schools and libraries (Mahdawi, 2024).

The implications of this policy could be far-reaching and chilling. By criminalizing librarians and educators for providing access to a broad range of literature, including works that feature LGBTQ+ characters or themes, Project 2025 seeks to control not only what information is available but also who is allowed to disseminate that information. This could lead to an environment of fear and self-censorship among educators and librarians, further limiting access to diverse perspectives and undermining the very purpose of public education.

**Potential Concerns:**  
The notion of criminalizing educators and librarians for offering access to what Project 2025 vaguely labels as "pornography" raises significant concerns about government overreach and the suppression of free speech. By using such a broad and undefined term, the plan enables the persecution of individuals for simply providing access to materials that may challenge conservative views on gender and sexuality. This is not just an attack on pornography; it is an attack on progress, diversity, and the fundamental right to access information.

### **Conclusion**

Project 2025 proposes a stringent approach to the regulation and potential banning of pornography, reflecting broader conservative concerns about morality and public decency. While these measures aim to protect children and uphold community standards, they raise significant concerns about censorship, privacy, government overreach, and the potential erosion of civil liberties. The most alarming aspect is the proposal to criminalize librarians and educators under the guise of protecting children from pornography, which is so broadly defined that it could include legitimate educational materials and LGBTQ+ content. This approach threatens to drive the pornography industry underground, restrict access to diverse viewpoints, and create a chilling effect on free speech and public discourse. As these proposals are considered, it is crucial to carefully weigh the need for regulation against the potential risks to individual freedoms and democratic values.

## <span id="nutshell">"Regulation and Banning of Pornography in Project 2025" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025 proposes strict measures to regulate and potentially ban pornography, reflecting conservative concerns about morality and public decency. The plan includes rigorous age verification requirements, content restrictions, and increased penalties for the illegal distribution of pornography, including child exploitation material. While these measures aim to protect children and uphold community standards, they raise significant concerns about privacy, censorship, and government overreach.

**Privacy Concerns:**  
The proposed age verification measures could require users to provide government-issued IDs, risking privacy violations and data breaches. Users may be forced to share sensitive personal information to access legal adult content, which could lead to unintended consequences, including the misuse of personal data.

**Censorship and Free Speech:**  
The plan's vague definitions of "obscene" or "degrading" content could lead to arbitrary censorship. This opens the door to politically motivated suppression of content that challenges conservative views, particularly LGBTQ+ literature and discussions on non-normative gender identities. The broad authority to ban content deemed harmful to society could also extend beyond pornography, threatening free speech and artistic expression.

**Criminalizing Educators and Librarians:**  
One of the most concerning aspects of Project 2025 is the proposal to criminalize educators and public librarians who provide access to materials that could be labeled as pornography. The term "pornography" is so broadly defined that it could encompass LGBTQ+ content, sex education, or any media that challenges traditional gender norms. This approach could lead to educators and librarians being charged as sex offenders for simply doing their jobs, fostering a climate of fear and self-censorship in public institutions.

**Impact on the Industry:**  
The proposed regulations could drive the pornography industry underground, making it more difficult for consumers to access legal, regulated content. This could lead to an increase in unregulated or illegal distribution channels, exposing users to greater risks, such as fraud, exploitation, and illegal material. The economic impact on the legal adult entertainment industry could be severe, potentially leading to job losses and financial strain on companies that operate within the law.

**Government Overreach:**  
The far-reaching implications of these proposals include an erosion of civil liberties and the suppression of lawful expression. By criminalizing access to certain types of content and targeting those who distribute it, Project 2025 threatens to undermine the fundamental rights to free speech and access to information. This isn't just about regulating pornography—it's about controlling cultural narratives and restricting progress, particularly in areas related to gender and sexuality.

In summary, while Project 2025's proposals aim to protect public morality and children, they pose serious risks to privacy, free speech, and civil liberties. The plan's vague definitions and broad enforcement powers could lead to widespread censorship and criminalization of legitimate content, with far-reaching consequences for individual freedoms and democratic values.
