# Proposed Changes to Voting Rights and Election Processes in Project 2025: Assessing the Risks to Democracy

**Introduction**

Project 2025 outlines a series of changes to the voting rights and election processes in the United States, aimed at ensuring election integrity and increasing confidence in the electoral system. However, these proposed changes also raise significant concerns about the potential for voter suppression, reduced access to voting, and the overall impact on democratic participation. This analysis will explore the specific changes proposed in Project 2025, assess their potential impact on voting rights and the election process, and evaluate the broader implications for American democracy.

**Voter Identification Requirements**

One of the central proposals in Project 2025 is the implementation of stricter voter identification (ID) requirements across the United States. The plan advocates for requiring all voters to present government-issued photo identification at the polls, arguing that this is necessary to prevent voter fraud and ensure that only eligible citizens participate in elections (Project 2025, 2024, Federal Election Commission).

**Potential Concerns**

While voter ID requirements are framed as a way to protect the integrity of elections, they have been widely criticized for disproportionately affecting certain groups of voters, including low-income individuals, racial minorities, the elderly, and young people. These groups are less likely to have access to the necessary identification, which could result in their disenfranchisement. Research has shown that voter ID laws can lead to lower voter turnout, particularly among marginalized communities, thereby reducing the representativeness of elections.

Moreover, the emphasis on preventing voter fraud, which is exceedingly rare in the United States, could be seen as a justification for implementing measures that make it more difficult for eligible voters to cast their ballots. This raises concerns about the true intent behind these policies and whether they are designed to suppress voter participation rather than protect election integrity.

**Limitations on Mail-In and Early Voting**

Project 2025 also proposes tightening restrictions on mail-in and early voting, citing concerns about the potential for fraud and the need for uniform voting procedures. The plan suggests limiting the availability of mail-in ballots to only those who can provide a valid excuse, such as being out of the country on Election Day, and reducing the early voting period to a more standardized and shorter timeframe (Project 2025, 2024, Federal Election Commission).

**Potential Concerns**

Reducing access to mail-in and early voting could significantly impact voter turnout, particularly among those who rely on these methods due to work schedules, health issues, or other personal circumstances. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many voters turned to mail-in and early voting as safer and more convenient options, leading to record voter turnout. Limiting these options could reverse this trend, making it more difficult for many Americans to participate in the democratic process.

The argument that these measures are necessary to prevent fraud is problematic, as there is little evidence to suggest that mail-in voting is more susceptible to fraud than in-person voting. By restricting these voting methods, Project 2025 risks disenfranchising voters and undermining the accessibility and inclusivity of the electoral system.

**Changes to Voter Registration Processes**

Another significant proposal in Project 2025 is the reform of voter registration processes. The plan advocates for the implementation of stricter voter roll maintenance procedures, including the purging of inactive voters from the rolls and the verification of voter registration information against other government databases. The goal is to ensure that voter rolls are accurate and up-to-date, preventing ineligible individuals from voting (Project 2025, 2024, Federal Election Commission).

**Potential Concerns**

While accurate voter rolls are important for the integrity of elections, aggressive voter roll purges can lead to the removal of eligible voters from the rolls, particularly those who have not voted in recent elections or who have moved. Purging voters without adequate notice or safeguards can result in eligible voters being turned away at the polls, often without their knowledge until it is too late to correct the issue.

The verification of voter registration information against other government databases also raises concerns about data accuracy and the potential for errors. Mismatches in data, which can occur due to variations in how names or addresses are recorded, could lead to eligible voters being wrongfully removed from the rolls. These measures could disproportionately affect minority voters and those in lower socioeconomic brackets, further exacerbating inequalities in voter access and participation.

**Changes to Redistricting Practices**

Project 2025 also addresses the issue of redistricting, proposing reforms aimed at reducing the influence of partisan gerrymandering. The plan suggests that states adopt independent redistricting commissions or use objective criteria to draw district boundaries, rather than allowing state legislatures to control the process (Project 2025, 2024, Federal Election Commission).

**Potential Concerns**

While the intention to reduce partisan gerrymandering is a positive step toward fairer elections, the implementation of these reforms is crucial. Independent redistricting commissions can help create more competitive and representative districts, but if not designed and implemented properly, they could still be subject to manipulation or political influence. Ensuring that these commissions are truly independent and operate transparently is essential to achieving the goal of fair redistricting.

Additionally, without federal oversight, there is a risk that some states could resist adopting these reforms, leading to continued gerrymandering practices that distort electoral outcomes and diminish voter representation. The success of these reforms will depend on their uniform adoption and enforcement across all states.

**Implications of the Immunity Ruling**

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which provides greater protections for government officials from legal challenges, could have significant implications for the implementation of Project 2025’s proposed changes to voting rights and election processes. By reducing the ability of individuals and organizations to challenge election laws and practices, the ruling could make it more difficult to address instances of voter suppression, gerrymandering, or other practices that undermine the democratic process.

This lack of accountability could lead to more aggressive implementation of restrictive voting laws, with limited opportunities for legal recourse for those affected. The immunity ruling could also embolden state and local officials to enact measures that disproportionately affect certain groups of voters, further eroding public trust in the electoral system.

**Conclusion**

Project 2025’s proposed changes to voting rights and election processes represent a significant shift in how elections are conducted in the United States. While the stated goal is to enhance election integrity, these proposals raise serious concerns about the potential for voter suppression, reduced access to voting, and the overall impact on democratic participation.

Stricter voter ID requirements, limitations on mail-in and early voting, and aggressive voter roll purges could disproportionately affect marginalized communities, leading to lower voter turnout and less representative elections. The proposed redistricting reforms offer a potential path toward fairer elections, but their success will depend on careful implementation and enforcement.

The implications of the immunity ruling further complicate the picture, as it could reduce the ability of voters to challenge unfair or discriminatory election practices. In light of these concerns, it is essential to scrutinize Project 2025’s proposals carefully to ensure that they do not undermine the principles of fairness, inclusivity, and equal representation that are fundamental to American democracy. Protecting the right to vote and ensuring accessible, transparent, and fair elections are crucial to maintaining public trust in the democratic process.

## <span id="nutshell">"What Changes to Voting Rights and Election Processes Are Proposed?" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025 proposes a series of changes to voting rights and election processes that could significantly impact how elections are conducted in the United States. While these changes are presented as measures to enhance election integrity, they raise several serious concerns about voter access, fairness, and the potential for voter suppression.

First, the project advocates for stricter voter ID requirements, mandating that all voters present government-issued photo identification at the polls. While this is framed as a way to prevent voter fraud, which is exceedingly rare, these requirements could disproportionately affect certain groups of voters, including low-income individuals, racial minorities, the elderly, and young people. These groups are less likely to have access to the necessary identification, which could lead to their disenfranchisement and lower voter turnout in these communities.

Second, Project 2025 suggests limiting access to mail-in and early voting. The plan proposes restricting mail-in ballots to only those who can provide a valid excuse, such as being out of the country on Election Day, and shortening the early voting period. These restrictions could make it harder for many people to vote, especially those who rely on these methods due to work schedules, health issues, or other personal circumstances. Reducing these options could lead to lower voter participation, particularly among those who find it difficult to vote in person on Election Day.

Third, the project calls for more aggressive maintenance of voter rolls, including purging inactive voters and verifying registration information against other government databases. While keeping voter rolls accurate is important, aggressive purges can result in eligible voters being removed from the rolls, especially if they haven’t voted in recent elections or if there are errors in their information. This could lead to eligible voters being turned away at the polls without their knowledge until it’s too late to correct the issue.

Additionally, Project 2025 proposes reforms to redistricting practices to reduce partisan gerrymandering. While the intention to create fairer electoral districts is commendable, the success of these reforms will depend on their implementation. If not carefully designed and enforced, there is a risk that gerrymandering could continue, distorting electoral outcomes and diminishing voter representation.

Finally, the recent Supreme Court immunity ruling could make it harder for individuals and organizations to challenge unfair or discriminatory election practices. This ruling could embolden state and local officials to implement restrictive voting laws with limited accountability, further eroding trust in the electoral system.

In summary, while Project 2025’s proposals aim to enhance election integrity, they pose significant risks to voter access and fairness. Stricter voter ID requirements, limitations on mail-in and early voting, aggressive voter roll purges, and the potential impacts of the immunity ruling could all contribute to a less inclusive and representative electoral process. These concerns highlight the need for careful scrutiny of these proposals to ensure that they do not undermine the fundamental democratic principles of fairness, inclusivity, and equal representation.
