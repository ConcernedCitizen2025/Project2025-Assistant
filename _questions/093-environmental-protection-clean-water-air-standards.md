# Project 2025’s Proposed Changes to Federal Environmental Regulations: A Detailed Analysis

**Introduction**

Environmental protection, particularly concerning clean water and air standards, has been a cornerstone of U.S. federal regulations for decades. Project 2025 proposes significant changes to these regulations, aiming to streamline processes, reduce regulatory burdens on businesses, and shift more control to state and local governments. This analysis explores the proposed changes, their potential impacts on environmental quality, public health, and the broader implications for U.S. democracy.

**Proposed Changes to Clean Water Standards**

Project 2025 advocates for revising federal regulations under the Clean Water Act (CWA) to limit the scope of federal oversight and expand state and local authority. The plan suggests that the federal government has overstepped its bounds in regulating water resources, particularly concerning the definition of "waters of the United States" (WOTUS), which determines which bodies of water are subject to federal protection (Project 2025, 2024, Environmental Protection Agency).

The proposed changes include narrowing the definition of WOTUS to exclude many smaller streams, wetlands, and other water bodies from federal regulation. The rationale behind this shift is to reduce the regulatory burden on landowners, developers, and farmers, who often face restrictions and permit requirements when their activities affect federally protected waters.

**Potential Concerns**

While reducing the regulatory burden on businesses and landowners is a key goal of Project 2025, narrowing the definition of WOTUS raises significant environmental and public health concerns. Smaller streams and wetlands play a crucial role in maintaining the overall health of larger water bodies, filtering pollutants, and supporting biodiversity. Excluding these waters from federal protection could lead to increased pollution, habitat destruction, and degradation of water quality in downstream areas, ultimately affecting drinking water supplies and aquatic ecosystems.

Moreover, shifting regulatory authority to states may result in a patchwork of environmental protections, with some states adopting weaker standards than others. This could create inconsistencies in water quality across the country and make it more challenging to address pollution that crosses state lines.

**Proposed Changes to Clean Air Standards**

Project 2025 also seeks to reform federal regulations under the Clean Air Act (CAA), with a focus on reducing what it views as overregulation and promoting economic growth. The plan calls for revisiting and potentially rolling back air quality standards that are deemed overly stringent, particularly those related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and pollutants like ozone and particulate matter (Project 2025, 2024, Environmental Protection Agency).

The proposed changes include easing restrictions on industries that emit GHGs, such as power plants and manufacturing facilities, and granting states more flexibility in setting and enforcing air quality standards. Project 2025 argues that these changes are necessary to prevent the stifling of economic growth and to allow businesses to operate more efficiently without excessive regulatory constraints.

**Potential Concerns**

Rolling back air quality standards, particularly those related to GHG emissions, poses significant risks to public health and the environment. GHGs contribute to climate change, which has far-reaching impacts, including more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems. Easing restrictions on GHG emissions could undermine efforts to combat climate change and lead to worsening environmental conditions globally.

Relaxing standards for pollutants like ozone and particulate matter also raises concerns, as these pollutants are linked to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and premature deaths. Lowering air quality standards could disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and those with preexisting health conditions, exacerbating public health disparities.

**Implications of the Immunity Ruling**

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which shields federal officials from legal liabilities, could exacerbate concerns about the implementation of Project 2025’s environmental policies. By reducing accountability, the ruling may encourage more aggressive deregulation without adequate oversight or consideration of the long-term environmental and public health impacts. This lack of accountability could lead to regulatory decisions that prioritize short-term economic gains over the protection of natural resources and public health.

Moreover, the immunity ruling may limit the ability of citizens and environmental organizations to challenge harmful regulatory changes in court, further weakening environmental protections and undermining democratic processes.

**Conclusion**

Project 2025’s proposed changes to federal environmental regulations, particularly concerning clean water and air standards, reflect a broader effort to reduce regulatory burdens on businesses and shift more control to states. While these changes aim to promote economic growth and streamline regulatory processes, they raise significant concerns about the potential weakening of environmental protections.

Narrowing the scope of federal oversight under the Clean Water Act and easing air quality standards under the Clean Air Act could lead to increased pollution, habitat destruction, and public health risks. The implications of the immunity ruling further complicate these issues, as reduced accountability may result in more aggressive deregulation without adequate oversight.

In summary, while Project 2025 seeks to balance economic growth with environmental protection, its proposed changes risk undermining decades of progress in safeguarding clean water and air. Ensuring that environmental regulations continue to protect public health and natural resources, while promoting sustainable economic development, will be crucial in maintaining a healthy and resilient environment for future generations.

## <span id="nutshell">"Project 2025’s Proposed Changes to Federal Environmental Regulations" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025 proposes significant changes to federal regulations on environmental protection, specifically targeting clean water and air standards. The plan emphasizes reducing federal oversight, particularly by narrowing the definition of "waters of the United States" (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act, and easing air quality standards under the Clean Air Act. These changes aim to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses, landowners, and states, promoting economic growth and reducing federal intervention.

However, these proposals raise several critical concerns. Narrowing the scope of WOTUS could exclude many smaller streams, wetlands, and other water bodies from federal protection. This could lead to increased pollution, habitat destruction, and degradation of water quality, impacting drinking water supplies and aquatic ecosystems. The shift in regulatory authority to states might result in inconsistent environmental protections across the country, creating a patchwork of standards that could be less effective in safeguarding water quality.

Regarding air quality, Project 2025’s plan to ease restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants like ozone and particulate matter poses significant public health risks. These pollutants are linked to severe health issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and relaxing standards could exacerbate these problems, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with preexisting conditions. Additionally, easing restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions could undermine efforts to combat climate change, leading to more severe environmental impacts globally.

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling further complicates these issues by reducing accountability for federal officials implementing these changes. This could encourage more aggressive deregulation without sufficient oversight, potentially leading to decisions that prioritize short-term economic gains over long-term environmental and public health protections. The ruling may also limit the ability of citizens and environmental organizations to challenge harmful regulatory changes, weakening democratic processes and further undermining environmental protections.

In summary, while Project 2025 aims to promote economic growth by reducing regulatory burdens, its proposed changes to clean water and air standards risk significant environmental and public health consequences. The potential for increased pollution, weaker environmental protections, and reduced accountability highlights the need for careful consideration of the long-term impacts of these regulatory reforms. Ensuring that environmental regulations continue to protect public health and natural resources is crucial for maintaining a healthy and resilient environment for future generations.
