# Project 2025’s Policies on U.S. Economic and Military Aid in the Middle East: An In-Depth Analysis

**Introduction**

U.S. economic and military aid to countries in the Middle East has long been a cornerstone of American foreign policy, particularly in relation to the Israel-Palestine conflict. This aid is intended to promote stability, support allies, and advance U.S. strategic interests in a volatile region. Project 2025, a policy document outlining the future direction of a conservative U.S. administration, addresses how the U.S. should allocate economic and military aid in the Middle East, with a strong emphasis on maintaining support for Israel. This analysis explores the specific policies proposed by Project 2025, their potential implications, and the risks they may pose to regional stability, international relations, and U.S. democracy.

**Economic and Military Aid to Israel**

Project 2025 strongly emphasizes the continuation and potential expansion of U.S. military and economic aid to Israel. The document underscores Israel’s importance as a key ally in the Middle East, framing its security as a critical component of U.S. strategic interests in the region. To this end, Project 2025 proposes maintaining Israel’s qualitative military edge, which includes providing advanced military technology, intelligence-sharing, and joint military exercises. The document also suggests that the U.S. should ensure that Israel has the financial resources necessary to defend itself against regional threats, particularly from groups like Hamas and Hezbollah (Project 2025, 2024, [The Common Defense]).

Project 2025 also proposes continued economic support for Israel, particularly in areas that contribute to its defense capabilities. This includes funding for Israel’s missile defense systems, such as Iron Dome, and supporting Israeli research and development in defense technologies. The document emphasizes that this aid should be unconditional and not subject to reductions based on Israel’s actions in the West Bank or Gaza, signaling a clear commitment to Israel’s security over concerns about the humanitarian situation in Palestinian territories.

**Economic and Military Aid to Other Middle Eastern Countries**

Beyond Israel, Project 2025 takes a more conditional approach to U.S. aid to other countries in the Middle East. The document suggests that U.S. aid should be contingent on these countries aligning their policies with U.S. strategic interests, particularly in relation to counterterrorism and opposition to Iran’s influence in the region. Countries that fail to meet these conditions or that pursue policies deemed hostile to U.S. interests could see their aid reduced or eliminated altogether.

In the context of the Israel-Palestine conflict, Project 2025 implies that U.S. aid to countries that support Palestinian claims or that oppose Israel’s actions in the West Bank and Gaza might be reassessed. The document suggests that the U.S. should leverage its aid to encourage these countries to normalize relations with Israel, as seen with the Abraham Accords, and to reduce support for Palestinian factions that do not recognize Israel’s right to exist.

**Potential Concerns**

The policies outlined in Project 2025 regarding U.S. aid to Israel raise several concerns. First, the unconditional nature of the aid, particularly in the face of ongoing settlement expansion and military actions in Palestinian territories, could be seen as tacit approval of policies that violate international law and exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the West Bank. This could lead to further destabilization of the region, as Palestinians and their supporters become increasingly frustrated by the lack of international pressure on Israel to change its policies.

Moreover, the focus on maintaining Israel’s qualitative military edge could contribute to an arms race in the Middle East, as neighboring countries seek to counterbalance Israel’s military superiority. This could increase the likelihood of conflict and further entrench divisions in a region already marked by deep-seated hostilities.

The conditional approach to aid for other Middle Eastern countries also raises concerns. By tying aid to alignment with U.S. strategic interests, Project 2025 risks alienating countries that have historically relied on U.S. support but may pursue independent foreign policies. This could push these countries closer to other powers, such as Russia or China, that are less likely to impose similar conditions. Additionally, using aid as a tool to force countries to normalize relations with Israel could backfire, leading to increased resentment and resistance from populations that oppose normalization without progress on the Israel-Palestine conflict.

**Implications of the Immunity Ruling**

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which shields federal officials from certain legal liabilities, could have significant implications for the policies proposed in Project 2025. If U.S. officials are protected from legal challenges related to their decisions on foreign aid, they may feel more empowered to pursue aggressive policies that prioritize military and strategic interests over humanitarian concerns. This lack of accountability could lead to decisions that exacerbate conflicts in the Middle East, particularly in relation to the Israel-Palestine conflict, without fear of legal repercussions.

For example, U.S. officials could support Israeli military actions in Gaza or the West Bank that result in significant civilian casualties, knowing that they are unlikely to face legal consequences. This could further damage the U.S.’s reputation as a global leader in human rights and international law, while increasing anti-American sentiment in the region.

**Conclusion**

Project 2025’s policies regarding U.S. economic and military aid in the Middle East reflect a strong commitment to Israel’s security and a more conditional approach to other countries in the region. While this strategy aims to bolster U.S. strategic interests, it raises significant concerns about the potential for increased regional instability, the erosion of international law, and the alienation of key allies. The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling further exacerbates these risks by reducing accountability for U.S. officials, potentially leading to more aggressive and controversial policies. A more balanced approach that considers both strategic interests and humanitarian concerns is essential for ensuring long-term peace and stability in the Middle East.

Project 2025 advocates for strong, unconditional U.S. support for Israel, emphasizing continued and potentially increased military and economic aid. This aid is meant to ensure Israel’s security and maintain its military superiority in the region. The document also suggests that U.S. economic and military aid to other Middle Eastern countries should be contingent on their alignment with U.S. strategic interests, particularly regarding counterterrorism and opposition to Iran. Countries that do not meet these criteria, or that support Palestinian positions against Israel, could see their aid reduced or eliminated.

Several concerns arise from this approach. First, the unconditional nature of U.S. aid to Israel, despite ongoing settlement expansion and military actions in Palestinian territories, could be seen as endorsing policies that violate international law and contribute to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the West Bank. This might further destabilize the region and fuel resentment among Palestinians and other groups who see the U.S. as complicit in Israel’s actions.

The focus on maintaining Israel’s military edge could also lead to an arms race in the Middle East, with neighboring countries seeking to counterbalance Israel’s power. This could increase the likelihood of conflict and deepen existing hostilities in a region already fraught with tension.

The conditional approach to aid for other Middle Eastern countries poses additional risks. By tying aid to alignment with U.S. strategic interests, Project 2025 could alienate countries that pursue independent foreign policies. This could drive them closer to other global powers, like Russia or China, who are less likely to impose similar conditions. Additionally, using aid as leverage to push for normalization of relations with Israel could backfire, especially in countries where there is strong public opposition to normalization without progress on the Israel-Palestine conflict.

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which protects federal officials from legal liabilities, could make things worse by reducing accountability for decisions related to foreign aid. This could embolden U.S. officials to support aggressive policies that prioritize strategic interests over humanitarian concerns, potentially leading to more conflict and further damage to the U.S.’s global reputation.

In summary, Project 2025’s approach to U.S. aid in the Middle East prioritizes strategic interests, particularly Israel’s security, at the potential cost of regional stability, international law, and diplomatic relations. The immunity ruling adds another layer of concern by reducing accountability, which could result in more aggressive and potentially destabilizing U.S. policies in the region. A balanced approach that considers both security and humanitarian needs is crucial for ensuring long-term peace and stability.
