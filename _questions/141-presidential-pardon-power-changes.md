# Project 2025's Presidential Pardon Power: Risks to Justice and Accountability

## *Does Project 2025 propose any changes to the presidential pardon power, especially in light of the immunity ruling?*

**Introduction**

Project 2025 proposes changes to the presidential pardon power that could significantly reshape how clemency is granted, raising concerns about transparency and the potential for political abuse. By suggesting greater oversight and formal reporting mechanisms, Project 2025 aims to create a more accountable process. However, these reforms also introduce risks of politicizing the pardon process and creating delays that could undermine the justice system. Additionally, the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling may weaken these reforms, allowing the pardon power to be used in ways that further protect political allies from scrutiny. This analysis explores the potential consequences of Project 2025’s proposals, with a focus on preserving democratic accountability and justice.

#### **Proposed Changes to the Presidential Pardon Power**

Project 2025 discusses the need to reassess and potentially reform the scope of the presidential pardon power to ensure it is used judiciously and transparently (Project 2025, 2024, Executive Office of the President). The document acknowledges concerns about the potential for abuse of the pardon power, particularly in cases where pardons are granted to individuals close to the president or to shield political allies from legal consequences.

One of the key proposals in Project 2025 is to implement greater oversight and transparency in the pardon process. The plan suggests that while the president retains the ultimate authority to grant pardons, the process should involve more rigorous review by legal and ethics advisors within the executive branch. This review would include a comprehensive assessment of the circumstances surrounding each pardon request, ensuring that decisions are made based on legal merit rather than personal or political considerations.

Additionally, Project 2025 advocates for a more formalized reporting mechanism to Congress and the public, detailing the rationale behind each pardon granted. This would include a requirement for the president to provide a written explanation for each pardon, outlining the legal and ethical justifications for the decision. The goal is to enhance transparency and accountability, making it more difficult for the pardon power to be used in a manner that undermines public trust.

**Potential Concerns:**  
While these proposals aim to improve the transparency and accountability of the presidential pardon process, they also raise concerns about the potential politicization of the pardon power. Increasing oversight and requiring a formalized reporting mechanism could lead to greater scrutiny and political pressure on the president, potentially deterring the use of pardons in cases where clemency is warranted but politically unpopular. Moreover, the emphasis on legal and ethical review could create a bureaucratic process that slows down the decision-making process, potentially leaving deserving individuals waiting for relief. Additionally, there is a risk that these reforms could be selectively enforced, depending on the political climate, leading to inconsistencies in how the pardon power is applied.

#### **Impact of the Immunity Ruling on Pardon Power**

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling could have significant implications for the presidential pardon power as outlined in Project 2025. If the ruling grants broad immunity to government officials, it could further complicate the dynamics of the pardon process. For example, if high-ranking officials or political allies are protected by immunity, the president may feel less constrained in granting pardons to these individuals, knowing that their actions are shielded from legal challenges. This could undermine the reforms proposed in Project 2025, allowing for the continued use of pardons in ways that might not align with principles of justice and accountability. The immunity ruling might also limit the ability of Congress or other entities to investigate or challenge controversial pardons, reducing the effectiveness of the proposed transparency and oversight mechanisms.

#### **Conclusion**

Project 2025 proposes reforms to the presidential pardon power aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability, including greater oversight and a formalized reporting mechanism. While these measures are intended to prevent abuses of the pardon power, they also raise concerns about potential politicization and the effectiveness of these reforms in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. The ruling could weaken the impact of these proposed changes, making it more difficult to hold the president accountable for controversial pardons. As these proposals are considered, it is crucial to balance the need for reform with the preservation of the pardon power’s role in the justice system, ensuring that it remains a tool for mercy rather than a mechanism for political favoritism.

## <span id="nutshell">"Changes to Presidential Pardon Power in Project 2025" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025 proposes reforms to the presidential pardon power aimed at increasing transparency and accountability. These reforms include implementing greater oversight within the executive branch, involving legal and ethics advisors in the pardon process, and requiring the president to provide a written explanation for each pardon. The goal is to ensure that the pardon power is used judiciously and not for personal or political gain.

**Increased Oversight:** Project 2025 suggests that the pardon process should involve more rigorous review to prevent the abuse of power. While this is intended to enhance accountability, it raises concerns about the potential politicization of the pardon process. Greater scrutiny and pressure could deter the president from granting pardons in cases where clemency is warranted but politically controversial. Additionally, the bureaucratic review process could delay decisions, leaving individuals waiting for relief.

**Formalized Reporting Mechanism:** The requirement for the president to provide a detailed explanation for each pardon aims to make the process more transparent. However, this could also lead to inconsistencies in how pardons are applied, depending on the political climate. The risk is that this transparency could be used selectively, potentially undermining the fairness of the process and turning the pardon power into a political tool rather than a mechanism for justice.

**Impact of the Immunity Ruling:** The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling could weaken the effectiveness of these proposed reforms. If government officials or political allies are protected by broad immunity, the president may feel less constrained in granting pardons to these individuals, knowing they are shielded from legal challenges. This could undermine the reforms’ goals, allowing for the continued use of pardons in ways that might not align with principles of justice and accountability. Furthermore, the immunity ruling might limit the ability of Congress or other bodies to investigate or challenge controversial pardons, reducing the effectiveness of the proposed oversight mechanisms.

In summary, while Project 2025’s proposed changes to the presidential pardon power aim to prevent abuses and enhance transparency, they also bring about concerns related to politicization, potential delays, and the impact of the immunity ruling. These factors could diminish the effectiveness of the reforms, allowing the pardon power to continue being used in ways that may not fully align with democratic principles and accountability.
