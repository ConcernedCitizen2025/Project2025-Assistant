# Project 2025 and the Two-State Solution: An In-Depth Analysis

**Introduction**

The two-state solution has long been the cornerstone of international efforts to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict. It envisions an independent State of Palestine alongside the State of Israel, living in peace and security. However, the feasibility and desirability of this solution have been increasingly questioned in recent years. Project 2025, a comprehensive policy document outlining the goals of a potential future conservative U.S. administration, provides critical insights into how the U.S. might approach the two-state solution. This analysis explores Project 2025’s stance on the two-state solution, evaluates its implications, and assesses the potential threats to democracy and regional stability.

**Project 2025’s Stance on the Two-State Solution**

Project 2025 does not explicitly endorse or reject the two-state solution. However, the document’s emphasis on Israel’s security and its lack of substantive discussion on Palestinian statehood suggests a departure from the traditional U.S. policy that has supported the two-state solution as the best path to peace. The document primarily focuses on strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship, ensuring Israel’s military superiority in the region, and supporting Israel’s actions against perceived threats from Palestinian groups (Project 2025, 2024, [The Common Defense]).

This approach implicitly sidelines the two-state solution by prioritizing Israel’s security concerns over Palestinian aspirations for statehood. Project 2025 advocates for continued and potentially increased military aid to Israel, robust diplomatic support in international forums, and a strong stance against any international pressure that might demand Israeli concessions. These policies are consistent with a framework that sees the Israel-Palestine conflict primarily through the lens of counterterrorism and national security, rather than as a territorial or political dispute that could be resolved through the creation of an independent Palestinian state.

**Potential Concerns**

The lack of a clear endorsement of the two-state solution in Project 2025 raises several significant concerns. First, by not supporting the two-state solution, the U.S. risks further entrenching the status quo, where the occupation of Palestinian territories continues indefinitely. This could exacerbate tensions and lead to more violence, as Palestinians increasingly lose hope in achieving independence through peaceful means.

Furthermore, the sidelining of the two-state solution could weaken the U.S.’s position as a mediator in the conflict. Traditionally, the U.S. has played a central role in facilitating negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, with the two-state solution as the ultimate goal. By moving away from this framework, the U.S. may lose credibility with both sides, as well as with other international actors who continue to support the two-state solution.

Another concern is the impact on regional stability. The two-state solution is widely viewed as the most viable option for achieving long-term peace in the Middle East. Abandoning this goal could lead to a power vacuum, where extremist groups gain influence, and regional actors are drawn into the conflict. This could destabilize not only Israel and Palestine but also neighboring countries like Jordan and Lebanon, which have significant Palestinian populations.

**Implications of the Immunity Ruling**

The recent Supreme Court immunity ruling, which provides broad protections for federal officials from legal liabilities, could have profound implications for U.S. policies in the Israel-Palestine conflict. If U.S. officials are shielded from legal accountability, they may feel more empowered to pursue aggressive policies that disregard Palestinian rights and international law. This could include supporting Israeli actions that undermine the possibility of a two-state solution, such as the expansion of settlements in the West Bank.

With reduced accountability, there is a heightened risk that U.S. policies could contribute to the erosion of the two-state solution without facing legal or political consequences. This could embolden Israeli policymakers to further entrench the occupation, making the creation of a viable Palestinian state increasingly difficult, if not impossible.

**Conclusion**

Project 2025’s approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict, while not explicitly rejecting the two-state solution, clearly prioritizes Israel’s security and strategic interests over the goal of Palestinian statehood. The lack of a clear endorsement of the two-state solution, combined with the emphasis on military and diplomatic support for Israel, suggests a shift away from this long-standing U.S. policy. This shift poses significant risks to regional stability, U.S. credibility as a mediator, and the possibility of achieving a lasting peace.

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling further exacerbates these concerns by reducing accountability for U.S. officials involved in these policies. Without legal consequences, there is a real danger that U.S. actions could undermine the two-state solution, leading to more violence and instability in the region. To ensure long-term peace and uphold democratic values, a more balanced approach that genuinely supports the two-state solution and respects the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians is essential.

## <span id="nutshell">"Project 2025 and the Two-State Solution" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025 doesn’t explicitly support or reject the two-state solution, but its focus on Israel’s security and lack of attention to Palestinian statehood suggests it’s not a priority. The document emphasizes strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship through increased military aid and diplomatic support, without addressing the possibility of creating an independent Palestinian state. This approach indicates a shift away from the traditional U.S. policy that has supported the two-state solution as the best path to peace.

The main concern with this stance is that it could entrench the status quo, where the occupation of Palestinian territories continues indefinitely. Without the prospect of a two-state solution, tensions could escalate, leading to more violence and instability. This approach also risks undermining the U.S.’s role as a mediator in the conflict, as it may lose credibility with both Israelis and Palestinians, as well as with international actors who still support the two-state solution.

Abandoning the two-state solution could also destabilize the broader Middle East. The two-state solution is widely regarded as the most viable option for achieving lasting peace in the region. If this goal is sidelined, extremist groups could gain influence, and neighboring countries like Jordan and Lebanon, which have significant Palestinian populations, could be drawn into the conflict, further destabilizing the region.

The recent Supreme Court immunity ruling, which protects federal officials from legal liabilities, could make things worse. With less accountability, U.S. officials might feel more empowered to support aggressive policies that undermine the two-state solution, such as backing Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank. This could further diminish the chances of achieving a viable Palestinian state and increase the risk of long-term conflict and instability.

In summary, Project 2025’s approach, while heavily focused on Israel’s security, overlooks the importance of the two-state solution. This could lead to more violence, undermine U.S. credibility, and destabilize the region. The immunity ruling adds another layer of concern by reducing accountability for U.S. actions, potentially making the situation even more volatile. To ensure peace and stability, a balanced approach that genuinely supports both Israeli security and Palestinian statehood is crucial.
