# Proposed Changes to LGBTQ+ Rights in Project 2025: Assessing the Threats to Democracy

## *What changes does Project 2025 propose for LGBTQ+ rights, including marriage equality and anti-discrimination protections?*

**Introduction**

Project 2025 outlines sweeping policy changes that could significantly impact the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly in the areas of anti-discrimination protections and marriage equality. These proposed changes threaten to reverse years of progress in securing equal rights and legal recognition for people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. This analysis delves into the specific risks posed by these policy shifts and their broader implications for civil liberties and democracy in the United States.

**Rescinding Anti-Discrimination Protections**

One of the most concerning proposals from Project 2025 is to **“rescind regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics”** (Project 2025, 2024, p. 584). This move would dismantle protections that currently shield LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination in critical areas such as employment, housing, and public accommodations. Without these safeguards, marginalized communities could face heightened exclusion and prejudice, particularly in regions that lack state-level protections.

**Potential Concerns**

By eliminating federal protections, this policy risks creating a fragmented system where basic rights depend on geographical location. In states with conservative governments, LGBTQ+ individuals could face significant barriers in accessing housing, securing jobs, and receiving equal treatment in everyday life. Such discrimination would not only harm individuals but could further entrench social inequality, undermining the core democratic principle of equal protection under the law.

Moreover, rescinding these protections would send a dangerous signal that discrimination based on identity is acceptable. The broader social consequences of this could be severe, fostering intolerance and perpetuating harmful stereotypes. As federal recognition of identity-based discrimination rolls back, the lived experiences of marginalized groups may be increasingly defined by marginalization and social exclusion.

**Marriage Equality**

In addition to undoing anti-discrimination laws, Project 2025 hints at potential challenges to marriage equality, particularly by allowing states to decide whether to recognize same-sex marriages. Such a proposal would not only undermine the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015) but also leave same-sex couples vulnerable to a patchwork of inconsistent legal standards depending on where they reside (Project 2025, 2024, Department of Justice). This could strip many families of the legal protections and benefits associated with marriage, from inheritance rights to parental rights.

**Targeting Education and Gender Identity**

Project 2025 also seeks to redefine "sex" under Title IX of the Education Amendments to mean only biological sex, thereby excluding gender identity and sexual orientation from protections. This shift would have dire consequences for transgender and gender non-conforming students, who would lose federal protection against discrimination in educational settings (Project 2025, 2024, Department of Education).

Limiting the discussion of gender diversity and sexual orientation in schools, as well as restricting how educators address students’ chosen pronouns and names, would significantly harm LGBTQ+ youth. Such policies increase the risk of bullying and psychological distress, as young people are denied recognition and support in environments that are supposed to foster learning and personal growth.

**Erasure of LGBTQ+ Terminology**

The **Foreword** of Project 2025 emphasizes a deliberate attempt to remove terms such as "sexual orientation," "gender identity," and other related phrases from federal rules, regulations, and even contracts (Project 2025, 2024, Foreword). This strategy not only represents a rollback of specific protections but signals a broader cultural push to erase LGBTQ+ identities from public discourse. By eliminating these terms from official documents, the government would be denying the legitimacy of these identities, which could embolden discriminatory practices in both public and private sectors.

**Conclusion**

Project 2025’s proposed changes to LGBTQ+ rights—including the rescission of anti-discrimination protections and potential challenges to marriage equality—pose a significant threat to both civil liberties and democratic values. By removing essential protections, the project could exacerbate social divisions, fuel discrimination, and create a patchwork of unequal rights across states. The focus on redefining "sex" in federal regulations and erasing LGBTQ+ terminology from official documents further reflects a broader agenda to marginalize and erase these communities from the national landscape. These proposals, if enacted, would not only harm LGBTQ+ individuals but could erode the foundational democratic principles of equality and justice for all.

It is essential to recognize these risks and critically evaluate the potential consequences of Project 2025, not just for marginalized communities, but for the health of American democracy itself.

## <span id="nutshell">"Proposed Changes to LGBTQ+ Rights in Project 2025" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025 proposes several major changes that could severely impact LGBTQ+ rights and roll back protections that have been established over the years. One of the most troubling aspects is the plan to **rescind regulations that prohibit discrimination** based on sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics. If these protections are removed, LGBTQ+ individuals could legally face discrimination in critical areas like employment, housing, and public services. Without federal protections, many states would be free to enact laws that could deny equal treatment to LGBTQ+ individuals, creating unequal rights across the country. This would lead to a patchwork of protections, leaving people vulnerable to discrimination depending on where they live.

Project 2025 also threatens **marriage equality**. The plan hints at allowing states to decide whether to recognize same-sex marriages, effectively rolling back the 2015 Supreme Court decision (*Obergefell v. Hodges*) that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. If this happens, same-sex couples in certain states could lose access to the legal benefits and rights that come with marriage, such as inheritance and parental rights.

In the realm of **education**, Project 2025 proposes redefining "sex" under Title IX to mean biological sex only, which would exclude protections for gender identity and sexual orientation. This change would have a direct impact on transgender and non-binary students, leaving them unprotected from discrimination in schools. It would also restrict discussions about LGBTQ+ topics in the classroom, further marginalizing LGBTQ+ youth. Limiting these discussions could lead to increased bullying and mental health challenges for these students, as they would no longer have institutional support or recognition in educational settings.

Another alarming proposal is the deliberate **removal of LGBTQ+ terminology** from federal rules and regulations. Project 2025 explicitly states its intent to delete terms like "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" from federal documents. This is not just a symbolic gesture—it would signal to society that these identities are not recognized or protected by the government. This could embolden private and public institutions to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals without fear of legal consequences.

Overall, Project 2025’s proposed changes pose a significant threat to the **civil rights** of LGBTQ+ individuals and could undermine **core democratic principles** such as equality and justice for all. If these changes are enacted, they would likely lead to increased social division and discrimination, leaving many LGBTQ+ people in vulnerable and hostile environments. This isn’t just about specific policies—it’s about the government legitimizing inequality and erasing protections that have been crucial to LGBTQ+ individuals’ ability to live openly and safely in society.
