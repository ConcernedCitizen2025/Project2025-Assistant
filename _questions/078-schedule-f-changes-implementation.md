# Project 2025’s Proposals for "Schedule F": An In-Depth Analysis

## *What is 'Schedule F,' and what changes does Project 2025 propose regarding its implementation?*

**Introduction**

"Schedule F" refers to an executive order introduced by former President Trump in 2020, aimed at reclassifying a large number of federal employees, stripping them of civil service protections and making them easier to hire and fire. Although rescinded by President Biden, Project 2025 proposes revisiting and expanding Schedule F to give the executive branch more control over the federal workforce. This analysis explores the potential impact of these proposals, assessing how they could alter the structure of the civil service and the balance of power within the U.S. government.

**What Is "Schedule F"?**

Schedule F was intended to reclassify federal employees who are involved in policy-making, policy implementation, or who have significant influence over agency decisions. This reclassification would move them out of the competitive service, where they enjoy certain job protections, and into the excepted service, where they could be hired or fired at will. The rationale behind Schedule F was to give the President and political appointees greater control over the federal bureaucracy, ensuring that employees who are resistant to the administration’s agenda could be more easily removed or replaced.

Under Schedule F, thousands of federal workers could potentially be reclassified, fundamentally altering the nature of the federal civil service. The employees affected by this reclassification would lose protections against being dismissed for political reasons, which have been a cornerstone of the civil service system since the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883.

**Project 2025’s Proposals for Schedule F**

Project 2025 strongly advocates for the reinstatement and expansion of Schedule F. The document argues that the federal bureaucracy has become too powerful, resistant to change, and often works against the policies of elected officials. According to Project 2025, reimplementing Schedule F would allow the executive branch to regain control over the federal workforce, ensuring that government employees are aligned with the administration’s policy goals (Project 2025, 2024, Central Personnel Agencies: Managing the Bureaucracy).

The key proposals related to Schedule F in Project 2025 include:

1. **Expanding the Scope of Schedule F**: Project 2025 proposes broadening the criteria for which federal employees would be classified under Schedule F. This could include not just those directly involved in policy-making but also those in positions that indirectly influence policy, significantly increasing the number of employees subject to reclassification.

2. **Streamlining the Process for Reclassification**: The document suggests that the process for identifying and reclassifying employees under Schedule F should be streamlined to allow for quicker and more efficient implementation. This would involve reducing bureaucratic hurdles and giving more authority to agency heads and political appointees to determine which positions should be reclassified.

3. **Increased Use of Executive Orders**: Project 2025 encourages the use of executive orders to bypass potential legislative or judicial obstacles to the implementation of Schedule F. This reflects a broader strategy within the document to use executive power to achieve policy goals without relying on Congress.

**Potential Concerns**

The proposals to expand and streamline Schedule F raise several significant concerns. First, reclassifying a large number of federal employees under Schedule F could lead to a highly politicized federal workforce. The civil service system was designed to protect federal employees from political interference, ensuring that they can carry out their duties based on expertise and merit rather than political loyalty. By stripping these protections, Project 2025’s proposals could create a work environment where employees are incentivized to align with the political views of the administration, potentially undermining the impartiality and effectiveness of the federal government.

Additionally, the expansion of Schedule F could lead to a "purge" of experienced and knowledgeable civil servants who might be seen as obstructive or uncooperative simply because they provide non-partisan advice that conflicts with political goals. This could result in a significant loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, weakening the government’s ability to develop and implement effective policies.

The use of executive orders to implement Schedule F, as proposed in Project 2025, also raises concerns about the concentration of power within the executive branch. Bypassing Congress to make such substantial changes to the civil service system could set a dangerous precedent, where executive overreach becomes normalized. This could further erode the checks and balances that are fundamental to the U.S. democratic system.

**Implications of the Immunity Ruling**

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which protects federal officials from legal liabilities, could exacerbate the risks associated with the implementation of Schedule F. If federal officials are shielded from lawsuits challenging their actions under Schedule F, there may be fewer avenues for recourse for employees who believe they have been unjustly dismissed. This lack of accountability could lead to more aggressive and unchecked use of Schedule F, with federal officials feeling emboldened to remove employees who are perceived as disloyal or obstructive, without fear of legal consequences.

The immunity ruling could also limit the effectiveness of judicial review as a safeguard against the abuse of Schedule F. If courts are less able or willing to intervene in disputes over the reclassification and dismissal of federal employees, the executive branch could gain disproportionate control over the federal workforce, undermining the principles of impartiality and meritocracy that have long governed the civil service.

**Conclusion**

Project 2025’s proposals regarding Schedule F represent a significant shift in the structure and functioning of the federal civil service. By expanding and streamlining the reclassification of federal employees, the document seeks to give the executive branch greater control over the bureaucracy, ensuring that government workers are aligned with the administration’s policy goals. However, these proposals raise serious concerns about the politicization of the federal workforce, the potential loss of expertise and institutional knowledge, and the erosion of checks and balances within the government.

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling further complicates these issues by reducing accountability for federal officials, potentially leading to more aggressive and unchecked implementation of Schedule F. To protect the integrity of the federal civil service and maintain the balance of power within the U.S. government, it is essential to carefully consider the potential consequences of these proposals and ensure that any reforms prioritize the principles of impartiality, meritocracy, and accountability.

## <span id="nutshell">"Project 2025’s Proposals for Schedule F" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025 advocates for the reinstatement and expansion of "Schedule F," a policy originally introduced by former President Trump to reclassify a significant number of federal employees. Schedule F would strip these employees of civil service protections, making it easier to hire and fire them based on political considerations. The aim is to give the executive branch greater control over the federal workforce, ensuring alignment with the administration’s policy goals.

However, this approach raises serious concerns. First, the expansion of Schedule F could lead to a highly politicized federal workforce. By removing the job protections that have long been a cornerstone of the civil service, employees might feel pressured to align with the political views of the current administration, undermining the impartiality and effectiveness of the government. This shift could result in a "loyalty-first" culture, where employees prioritize political alignment over merit and expertise.

Additionally, the potential for a widespread reclassification under Schedule F could lead to a significant loss of institutional knowledge and expertise within the federal government. Experienced civil servants who provide non-partisan advice might be dismissed simply because their views or expertise conflict with political objectives. This could weaken the government’s ability to effectively develop and implement policies, particularly in complex and technical areas.

Project 2025 also suggests using executive orders to implement Schedule F, bypassing Congress and consolidating more power within the executive branch. This approach could set a dangerous precedent for executive overreach, further eroding the checks and balances that are fundamental to U.S. democracy. The risk is that the executive branch could gain disproportionate control over the federal workforce, making it more difficult for other branches of government to provide necessary oversight.

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which protects federal officials from legal liabilities, exacerbates these concerns. With reduced accountability, federal officials might feel more emboldened to aggressively implement Schedule F, knowing they are shielded from lawsuits challenging their actions. This lack of accountability could lead to more unchecked use of Schedule F, further undermining the principles of impartiality and meritocracy that have traditionally governed the civil service.

In summary, while Project 2025’s proposals for Schedule F aim to enhance executive control over the federal workforce, they pose significant risks to the impartiality, effectiveness, and accountability of the federal government. The potential for politicization, loss of expertise, and increased executive overreach highlights the need for careful consideration and robust safeguards to protect the integrity of the civil service.
