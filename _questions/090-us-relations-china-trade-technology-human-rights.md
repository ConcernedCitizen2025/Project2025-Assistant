# U.S.-China Relations in Project 2025: Trade, Technology, and Human Rights

## *How does Project 2025 propose to handle relations with China, especially regarding trade, technology, and human rights issues?*


**Introduction**

As China continues to rise as a global superpower, U.S.-China relations have become a central issue in American foreign policy. Project 2025 outlines a bold approach to managing these relations, emphasizing key areas like trade, technology, and human rights. By advocating for aggressive trade measures, technological decoupling, and a firm stance on human rights violations, the plan seeks to protect American interests. However, this confrontational strategy could escalate tensions, disrupt global cooperation, and impact both U.S. democracy and international stability. In this analysis, we examine how Project 2025's proposals could reshape the complex relationship between the two nations.

**Trade Relations with China**

Project 2025 takes a firm stance on trade with China, emphasizing the need to protect American industries and reduce the U.S. trade deficit. The plan advocates for a more aggressive approach to trade negotiations, with the goal of achieving fairer trade terms that benefit the U.S. economy (Project 2025, 2024, Department of Commerce). It suggests using tariffs, sanctions, and other economic tools to pressure China into opening its markets and adhering to international trade norms.

The strategy also includes efforts to reduce U.S. dependency on Chinese manufacturing by encouraging the reshoring of industries and diversifying supply chains. Project 2025 calls for stronger enforcement of intellectual property rights and stricter regulations on Chinese investments in critical sectors of the U.S. economy.

**Potential Concerns**

While the focus on protecting American industries is understandable, the proposed use of tariffs and sanctions could escalate trade tensions, leading to a potential trade war with China. Such a conflict could have significant repercussions for the global economy, potentially disrupting supply chains and increasing costs for U.S. consumers and businesses.

Additionally, the emphasis on reshoring industries and reducing dependency on Chinese manufacturing might be challenging to implement on a large scale. The global economy is deeply interconnected, and efforts to decouple from China could be costly and time-consuming, with no guarantee of success. This strategy might also strain relations with U.S. allies who have economic ties to China, complicating international cooperation on trade and other issues.

**Technology and Innovation**

Project 2025 highlights the importance of maintaining U.S. technological superiority over China, particularly in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and 5G networks. The plan calls for increased investment in research and development, as well as collaboration with private industry to ensure that the U.S. remains at the forefront of technological innovation (Project 2025, 2024, Department of Commerce).

The strategy also includes measures to prevent the transfer of sensitive technologies to China, such as tightening export controls, scrutinizing Chinese investments in U.S. tech companies, and enhancing cybersecurity protections.

**Potential Concerns**

The focus on technological superiority is crucial, but the aggressive measures proposed in Project 2025 could lead to increased tensions with China. The tightening of export controls and investment restrictions might provoke retaliatory actions from China, potentially leading to a tech decoupling between the two countries. Such a scenario could disrupt global innovation and hinder collaboration on critical issues such as climate change, public health, and global security.

Moreover, the emphasis on protecting U.S. technologies from Chinese influence could lead to overregulation, stifling innovation and making it difficult for American companies to compete in the global market. There is also a risk that the focus on technological competition could overshadow the need for international cooperation in setting global standards for emerging technologies.

**Human Rights and Democracy**

Project 2025 takes a strong stance on China’s human rights record, particularly regarding the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, the repression of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, and the ongoing censorship and surveillance within China. The plan advocates for using economic and diplomatic pressure to hold China accountable for its human rights violations and to promote democratic values globally (Project 2025, 2024, Department of State).

The strategy includes supporting international efforts to investigate and sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses and promoting the rights of Chinese dissidents and activists.

**Potential Concerns**

While the focus on human rights is commendable, the strategy outlined in Project 2025 could face significant challenges in implementation. China’s influence on the global stage makes it difficult to build a broad international coalition willing to take strong action against Beijing. Additionally, economic and diplomatic pressure alone may not be sufficient to change China’s behavior, especially given the Chinese government’s historical resistance to external criticism.

There is also a concern that a hardline approach on human rights could further strain U.S.-China relations, complicating cooperation on other critical issues such as climate change and nuclear non-proliferation. The strategy might also provoke retaliatory measures from China, potentially affecting American businesses and citizens in China.

**Implications of the Immunity Ruling**

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which protects federal officials from legal liabilities, could have implications for how Project 2025’s strategies are implemented. By shielding officials from legal challenges, the ruling could reduce accountability for decisions related to trade, technology, and human rights, potentially leading to more aggressive or unilateral actions without sufficient oversight.

This lack of accountability might also make it more difficult to adjust strategies in response to changing circumstances or unintended consequences, increasing the risk of escalating tensions with China or harming U.S. interests. The ruling could also hinder efforts to build bipartisan support for the strategies outlined in Project 2025, as concerns about unchecked executive power may limit cooperation between different branches of government.

**Conclusion**

Project 2025 outlines a comprehensive and assertive strategy for handling relations with China, focusing on trade, technology, and human rights. While these proposals aim to protect U.S. interests and maintain American leadership on the global stage, they raise significant concerns about the potential for escalating tensions, disrupting global cooperation, and undermining civil liberties.

The emphasis on aggressive trade measures, technological competition, and human rights accountability could lead to a more confrontational relationship with China, with potential consequences for the global economy, innovation, and international stability. The implications of the immunity ruling further complicate these issues, as reduced accountability could increase the risk of overreach and unintended consequences.

As the U.S. navigates its complex relationship with China, it is crucial to balance assertiveness with caution, ensuring that strategies are carefully calibrated to protect American interests without exacerbating global tensions or undermining the principles of democracy and human rights.

## <span id="nutshell">"Project 2025’s Approach to U.S.-China Relations" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025 proposes a robust and confrontational approach to U.S.-China relations, focusing on three main areas: trade, technology, and human rights. While these proposals aim to protect U.S. interests and maintain American leadership globally, they raise several significant concerns.

First, the plan’s emphasis on aggressive trade measures, such as tariffs and sanctions, could lead to a trade war with China, disrupting global supply chains and raising costs for American consumers and businesses. The strategy also calls for reducing U.S. dependency on Chinese manufacturing, but this could be difficult and expensive to implement, potentially straining relations with allies who have economic ties to China.

In the realm of technology, Project 2025 prioritizes maintaining U.S. technological superiority through increased investment and stricter controls on technology transfers to China. However, this could escalate tensions, leading to a tech decoupling that might disrupt global innovation and hinder cooperation on critical issues like climate change and public health. There is also a risk of overregulation, which could stifle innovation and competitiveness among U.S. companies.

On human rights, Project 2025 takes a hardline stance against China’s abuses, advocating for economic and diplomatic pressure. While this focus on human rights is commendable, it may be difficult to build international support for strong action against China, and such a confrontational approach could further strain relations, complicating cooperation on other global challenges.

Additionally, the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which shields federal officials from legal liabilities, could reduce accountability in implementing these strategies. This lack of oversight might lead to more aggressive or unilateral actions without sufficient checks, increasing the risk of unintended consequences and escalating tensions with China.

In summary, while Project 2025’s approach to U.S.-China relations aims to protect American interests, it poses significant risks. The potential for trade conflicts, technological decoupling, and strained international relations, coupled with reduced accountability due to the immunity ruling, could have far-reaching negative consequences for both the U.S. and global stability. These concerns highlight the need for a more balanced and cautious approach in managing the complex relationship with China.
