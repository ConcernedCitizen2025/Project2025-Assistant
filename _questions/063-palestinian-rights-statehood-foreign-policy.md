# Palestinian Rights and Statehood in Project 2025: A Foreign Policy Analysis

## *How does Project 2025 address Palestinian rights and statehood in its foreign policy framework?*

**Introduction**

Project 2025 outlines a conservative vision for U.S. foreign policy, with particular emphasis on the Israel-Palestine conflict. The document largely frames the issue through the lens of Israeli security, offering limited discussion on Palestinian rights or the possibility of Palestinian statehood. This analysis examines Project 2025’s approach, highlighting its potential implications for U.S. diplomacy, regional stability, and global perceptions of American democracy.

**Palestinian Rights in Project 2025**

Project 2025 primarily frames the Israel-Palestine conflict through the lens of Israel's security and the U.S.'s strategic interests in the region. The document gives substantial attention to the threats posed by Palestinian militant groups like Hamas, and emphasizes the need for the U.S. to support Israel in countering these threats. However, it provides little to no substantive discussion on the rights of Palestinians or their aspirations for statehood. This omission suggests a one-dimensional approach that prioritizes Israeli security over a balanced consideration of Palestinian human rights (Project 2025, 2024, [The Common Defense]).

In terms of policy, Project 2025 appears to endorse the status quo, where the U.S. continues to support Israel’s actions in the occupied territories without significant criticism or intervention. The document does not propose any new initiatives to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the West Bank, nor does it suggest a framework for negotiations that could lead to a viable two-state solution. Instead, the focus remains on reinforcing Israel’s ability to defend itself and on rejecting international pressures that might demand concessions from Israel regarding settlements or the treatment of Palestinians.

**Potential Concerns**

The lack of emphasis on Palestinian rights in Project 2025 is deeply concerning for several reasons. Firstly, ignoring the grievances and aspirations of the Palestinian people could further entrench the status quo, where millions of Palestinians live under occupation with limited rights and no clear path to statehood. This approach risks perpetuating the cycle of violence and instability in the region, as unresolved tensions are likely to lead to continued resistance and conflict.

Furthermore, the document’s failure to address Palestinian rights could have broader implications for U.S. foreign policy. By aligning so closely with Israel and dismissing the concerns of Palestinians, the U.S. risks alienating key allies in the Arab and Muslim worlds. This could weaken U.S. influence in the region and create openings for other powers, such as Russia or China, to expand their influence.

Another significant concern is the impact on international law and human rights norms. By supporting Israeli policies that are widely condemned as violations of international law, such as settlement expansion in the West Bank, Project 2025 undermines the U.S.’s credibility as a defender of human rights. This could have ripple effects beyond the Middle East, as other countries may feel emboldened to disregard international norms, leading to a more unstable and fragmented global order.

**Statehood for Palestine: A Non-Starter in Project 2025**

Project 2025 does not explicitly address the issue of Palestinian statehood. The absence of any discussion on this topic suggests that the document does not view the establishment of a Palestinian state as a priority or even a possibility. This aligns with the broader trend in the document of focusing exclusively on Israeli security and strategic interests, while sidelining any initiatives that might lead to a negotiated settlement based on the two-state solution framework (Project 2025, 2024, [The Common Defense]).

The lack of attention to Palestinian statehood is significant because it indicates a departure from previous U.S. administrations, which at least nominally supported the idea of a two-state solution as the best path to peace. By not even mentioning the possibility of Palestinian statehood, Project 2025 effectively closes the door on this option, signaling a shift towards a more unilateral and Israel-centric approach to the conflict.

**Potential Concerns**

The omission of Palestinian statehood from Project 2025 is alarming for several reasons. First, it signals a potential abandonment of the two-state solution, which has long been considered the most viable path to a lasting peace in the region. Without the prospect of statehood, Palestinians may feel increasingly disenfranchised and desperate, leading to further radicalization and violence.

Additionally, the absence of a statehood discussion could undermine U.S. relations with other countries that support Palestinian independence, including many European allies. This could lead to a more isolated U.S. on the international stage, as other countries may view the U.S. as complicit in the continued occupation and denial of Palestinian self-determination.

Finally, the failure to address Palestinian statehood could have domestic implications as well. Within the U.S., there is a growing movement among some political groups and civil society organizations to support Palestinian rights and statehood. Ignoring these voices could lead to increased polarization and tension within the U.S., as debates over the Israel-Palestine conflict become more contentious.

**Implications of the Immunity Ruling**

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which provides broad protections for federal officials from legal liabilities, has significant implications for the policies outlined in Project 2025. This ruling could reduce accountability for U.S. officials involved in implementing these policies, particularly if they lead to human rights violations or exacerbate the conflict. With less fear of legal repercussions, policymakers might feel emboldened to pursue more aggressive strategies that disregard Palestinian rights and international law, further destabilizing the region and damaging U.S. credibility.

**Conclusion**

Project 2025’s approach to Palestinian rights and statehood is marked by its near-total omission of these issues. By focusing almost exclusively on Israeli security and U.S. strategic interests, the document fails to address the fundamental issues at the heart of the Israel-Palestine conflict. This one-sided approach risks perpetuating the status quo, undermining U.S. influence in the region, and eroding international law and human rights norms. The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling only exacerbates these concerns by reducing accountability for U.S. officials who implement these potentially harmful policies. To promote peace and stability in the Middle East, a more balanced and inclusive approach that recognizes the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians is essential.

## <span id="nutshell">"Project 2025 and Palestinian Rights" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025 largely ignores the rights of Palestinians and the issue of Palestinian statehood. The document is heavily focused on Israel's security and the U.S.'s strategic interests in the Middle East, but it fails to address the aspirations and grievances of the Palestinian people. This omission suggests that the U.S. would continue to support Israel unconditionally, without pushing for any meaningful resolutions to the Israel-Palestine conflict, such as a two-state solution.

The primary concern with this approach is that it could further entrench the status quo, where Palestinians live under occupation with limited rights and no clear path to statehood. This could perpetuate violence and instability in the region, as the underlying issues driving the conflict are left unaddressed. Moreover, by ignoring Palestinian rights, the U.S. risks alienating key allies in the Arab and Muslim worlds, which could weaken its influence in the Middle East and allow other powers like Russia or China to expand their presence.

Another significant concern is the potential erosion of international law and human rights norms. By supporting Israeli policies that are widely seen as violations of international law, such as settlement expansion in the West Bank, Project 2025 could undermine the U.S.'s credibility as a defender of human rights. This could encourage other countries to disregard international norms, leading to a more chaotic and unstable global order.

Project 2025 also does not mention Palestinian statehood, signaling a shift away from the two-state solution that has long been considered the best path to peace. Without the possibility of statehood, Palestinians may become more radicalized, leading to increased violence. Additionally, this approach could strain U.S. relations with European allies and others who support Palestinian independence, further isolating the U.S. on the global stage.

Finally, the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which shields federal officials from legal liabilities, could make it easier for U.S. policymakers to pursue aggressive strategies that ignore Palestinian rights without facing legal consequences. This lack of accountability could lead to more extreme actions that destabilize the region and damage the U.S.’s reputation worldwide.

In summary, Project 2025’s approach to Palestinian rights is deeply problematic. It ignores the core issues of the Israel-Palestine conflict, risks further instability in the Middle East, and undermines the U.S.'s role as a global leader in promoting human rights and international law. A more balanced approach is needed to ensure long-term peace and stability in the region.
