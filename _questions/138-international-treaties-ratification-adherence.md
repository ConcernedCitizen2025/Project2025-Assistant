# Project 2025's Approach to International Treaties: A Risk to Global Stability and U.S. Democracy

## *How does Project 2025 approach the ratification and adherence to international treaties?*

**Introduction**

Project 2025 presents a deliberate and potentially dangerous shift in how the U.S. engages with international treaties. By focusing on national sovereignty and economic interests over global cooperation, the plan introduces a high-risk strategy that could weaken international alliances and undermine U.S. credibility on the global stage. This cautious and often isolationist approach to treaty-making could also erode democratic oversight, concentrating more power in the executive branch. In this analysis, we explore the significant risks posed by Project 2025's approach to international treaties and how these changes could affect U.S. foreign policy, democratic governance, and global stability.

#### **Ratification of International Treaties**

Project 2025 emphasizes a more selective and cautious approach to the ratification of international treaties. The document argues that the U.S. should only enter into treaties that clearly serve its national interests and do not compromise its sovereignty or economic competitiveness (Project 2025, 2024, Department of State). The plan suggests that treaties should be thoroughly vetted to ensure that they align with U.S. strategic objectives and do not impose undue constraints on the nation’s ability to govern itself independently.

One of the key aspects of this approach is the insistence on rigorous scrutiny during the treaty negotiation and ratification process. Project 2025 proposes enhancing the role of Congress in treaty ratification, ensuring that treaties undergo extensive debate and review before being approved. This includes requiring that all treaties be subjected to detailed cost-benefit analyses, focusing on their potential impact on the U.S. economy, military, and sovereignty.

**Potential Concerns:**  
While a cautious approach to treaty ratification can protect national interests, it also raises concerns about the U.S.'s ability to engage effectively in global diplomacy. By setting high barriers for ratification, the U.S. may find it difficult to participate in multilateral treaties that require broad international cooperation, such as those addressing climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, or human rights. This could isolate the U.S. from global efforts to tackle pressing issues and weaken its influence in shaping international norms. Additionally, the emphasis on cost-benefit analyses might prioritize short-term economic gains over long-term global stability and security.

#### **Adherence to International Treaties**

Project 2025 also outlines a more stringent approach to the adherence to existing international treaties. The document advocates for a continuous review process to assess whether current treaties continue to serve U.S. interests. If a treaty is found to be disadvantageous or outdated, Project 2025 suggests that the U.S. should either seek to renegotiate the terms or consider withdrawing from the agreement altogether (Project 2025, 2024, Department of State).

This approach is based on the premise that international agreements should be dynamic and adaptable, reflecting the changing geopolitical landscape and national priorities. The plan argues that rigid adherence to treaties that no longer align with U.S. interests could hinder the country’s ability to respond to emerging threats and opportunities.

**Potential Concerns:**  
A policy of frequent reassessment and potential withdrawal from treaties could undermine the stability and predictability of international relations. Treaties are designed to provide a stable framework for cooperation and conflict resolution, and frequent changes to U.S. treaty commitments could erode trust among international partners. This could lead to a perception that the U.S. is an unreliable partner, making it more difficult to negotiate future agreements. Additionally, the potential for unilateral withdrawal from treaties could strain alliances and contribute to global instability, as other nations may respond by reconsidering their own commitments.

#### **Implications of the Immunity Ruling**

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling could have significant implications for the U.S. approach to treaty ratification and adherence as outlined in Project 2025. If government officials involved in treaty negotiations and implementation are granted broad immunity from legal challenges, it could reduce accountability in the treaty-making process. This might lead to decisions that are made with less transparency and input from Congress or the public, potentially undermining the democratic principles that are supposed to guide U.S. foreign policy. The immunity ruling could also limit the ability of affected parties to challenge decisions to withdraw from or violate treaty obligations, further concentrating power within the executive branch.

#### **Conclusion**

Project 2025 advocates for a selective and cautious approach to the ratification and adherence to international treaties, prioritizing national sovereignty and economic interests. While this approach is intended to protect U.S. interests, it raises concerns about the country’s ability to engage effectively in global diplomacy and uphold international commitments. The emphasis on frequent reassessment and potential withdrawal from treaties could undermine the stability of international relations and erode trust among U.S. allies and partners. The implications of the immunity ruling further complicate these issues, potentially reducing accountability and transparency in the treaty-making process. As these proposals are considered, it is crucial to balance national interests with the need for global cooperation and stability.

## <span id="nutshell">"Ratification and Adherence to International Treaties in Project 2025" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025 proposes a cautious and selective approach to the ratification and adherence to international treaties, prioritizing U.S. sovereignty and economic interests over global commitments. While this approach aims to protect national interests, it raises several significant concerns.

**Selective Ratification:** The plan emphasizes rigorous scrutiny of treaties before ratification, requiring detailed cost-benefit analyses to ensure they align with U.S. strategic objectives. While this can protect national interests, it risks isolating the U.S. from important multilateral treaties that require broad international cooperation. By setting high barriers for ratification, the U.S. may find it difficult to engage in global efforts to address pressing issues like climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, and human rights. This could weaken U.S. influence in shaping international norms and diminish its role as a global leader.

**Frequent Reassessment and Withdrawal:** Project 2025 also advocates for continuous review and potential withdrawal from existing treaties if they are deemed no longer advantageous. While this approach allows for adaptability, it could undermine the stability and predictability of international relations. Frequent reassessment and potential withdrawal could erode trust among international partners, leading to a perception that the U.S. is an unreliable partner. This could strain alliances, complicate future negotiations, and contribute to global instability as other nations may respond by reconsidering their own commitments.

**Implications of the Immunity Ruling:** The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling could further exacerbate these concerns by reducing accountability and transparency in the treaty-making process. If government officials involved in treaty negotiations and implementation are granted broad immunity from legal challenges, it could lead to decisions made with less input from Congress or the public. This concentration of power within the executive branch could undermine democratic principles and make it more difficult to challenge decisions that affect international commitments.

In summary, while Project 2025’s approach to international treaties is designed to prioritize U.S. interests, it risks isolating the country from global cooperation, weakening its influence in international affairs, and destabilizing long-standing international relationships. The potential impact of the immunity ruling further heightens these concerns, making it essential to carefully consider the long-term consequences of this approach on U.S. foreign policy and global stability.
