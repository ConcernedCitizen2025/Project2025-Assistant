# Balancing Support for Israel with Addressing Humanitarian Concerns in Gaza: An Analysis of Project 2025

**Introduction**

Project 2025 is a detailed policy blueprint designed to guide the U.S. under a future conservative administration. It emphasizes strong support for Israel, which has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. However, this commitment to Israel's security and strategic interests raises critical questions about how the U.S. might address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. This analysis examines how Project 2025 proposes to balance unwavering support for Israel with the need to address the severe humanitarian concerns in Gaza, and explores the potential risks and implications of its approach.

**Project 2025’s Approach to Supporting Israel**

Project 2025 places significant emphasis on ensuring Israel’s security and maintaining its qualitative military edge in the region. The document advocates for continued military aid, including advanced weaponry and missile defense systems, and emphasizes the importance of intelligence-sharing and joint military exercises. The rationale is that a strong Israel is crucial for regional stability and for countering threats from groups like Hamas, which are viewed as terrorist organizations (Project 2025, 2024, [The Common Defense]).

In this context, Project 2025 highlights the U.S.'s role in diplomatically supporting Israel in international forums, particularly in defending against what it perceives as unfair criticism or biased resolutions, such as those that might arise in the United Nations. The document suggests that the U.S. should use its influence to protect Israel from international pressures that could compromise its security, including calls for concessions or restraint in its military operations.

**Addressing Humanitarian Concerns in Gaza**

Despite its strong focus on Israel's security, Project 2025 provides minimal attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The document does acknowledge the difficult living conditions in Gaza, but it frames these issues primarily in terms of security threats posed by Hamas and other militant groups. The humanitarian situation is often depicted as a consequence of Hamas’s control over Gaza, with little emphasis on the broader socio-economic factors or the impact of the ongoing blockade and military actions.

Project 2025 does not propose specific policies aimed at alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, nor does it outline a balanced approach that considers both Israeli security and Palestinian human rights. The document implies that any humanitarian aid to Gaza should be carefully monitored to ensure it does not inadvertently strengthen Hamas or other militant groups. This stance suggests a limited and security-focused perspective on humanitarian aid, rather than a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of the crisis.

**Potential Concerns**

The limited attention to humanitarian concerns in Gaza within Project 2025 is concerning for several reasons. Firstly, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a significant and pressing issue that affects millions of people. By not addressing this adequately, the U.S. risks exacerbating the suffering of the civilian population and contributing to further destabilization in the region. The lack of a balanced approach that considers both security and humanitarian needs could lead to a perpetuation of the cycle of violence and retaliation.

Additionally, the focus on security at the expense of humanitarian concerns could damage the U.S.'s reputation as a global leader in promoting human rights. The international community, including key U.S. allies in Europe and the Arab world, might view this approach as callous or indifferent to the plight of Palestinians. This could lead to increased diplomatic isolation and a loss of influence in the Middle East, making it harder for the U.S. to broker peace or engage in meaningful dialogue with all parties involved.

Another significant concern is the potential for U.S. policies to inadvertently worsen the situation in Gaza. By prioritizing military aid and security cooperation with Israel, the U.S. might contribute to actions that exacerbate the humanitarian crisis, such as military operations that result in civilian casualties or the destruction of vital infrastructure. Without a clear strategy for balancing support for Israel with efforts to improve conditions in Gaza, the U.S. could be seen as complicit in the ongoing suffering of the Palestinian population.

**Implications of the Immunity Ruling**

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which provides broad protections to federal officials from legal liabilities, could have serious implications for the U.S.'s approach to Gaza under Project 2025. This ruling might reduce accountability for U.S. officials involved in implementing policies that impact Gaza, particularly if those policies result in human rights violations or exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. With less fear of legal repercussions, policymakers may feel emboldened to support more aggressive actions that prioritize Israeli security over Palestinian welfare, potentially leading to further destabilization and international criticism.

**Conclusion**

Project 2025’s approach to balancing support for Israel with addressing humanitarian concerns in Gaza is heavily skewed towards security considerations, with little emphasis on alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian population. This one-sided focus risks exacerbating the humanitarian crisis, damaging the U.S.’s global standing, and further destabilizing the region. The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling compounds these risks by reducing accountability for U.S. actions in the region, potentially leading to more aggressive policies that neglect humanitarian concerns. To ensure long-term peace and stability, it is essential for U.S. policy to adopt a more balanced approach that considers both Israeli security and the urgent humanitarian needs in Gaza.

## <span id="nutshell">"Balancing Support for Israel with Addressing Humanitarian Concerns in Gaza" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025 heavily emphasizes support for Israel’s security, advocating for continued military aid, joint exercises, and strong diplomatic backing in international forums. However, it provides little attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where millions of Palestinians live under harsh conditions. The document primarily frames Gaza’s issues through a security lens, focusing on threats from groups like Hamas, rather than addressing the broader humanitarian needs of the civilian population.

One of the main concerns is that Project 2025 doesn’t propose specific policies to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. By focusing almost exclusively on security and downplaying the dire conditions in Gaza, the U.S. risks worsening the situation, which could lead to more violence and instability. The lack of a balanced approach that considers both Israeli security and Palestinian human rights could perpetuate the cycle of conflict and suffering.

This one-sided focus also risks damaging the U.S.’s reputation as a global leader in human rights. The international community, including key U.S. allies, may see this approach as indifferent to the suffering of Palestinians, leading to increased diplomatic isolation and reduced influence in the Middle East. Without addressing the humanitarian crisis, the U.S. might find it harder to engage in peace negotiations or build trust with other regional actors.

Additionally, by prioritizing military aid and security cooperation with Israel, the U.S. could inadvertently contribute to actions that exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, such as military operations that harm civilians or destroy infrastructure. Without a clear strategy to balance support for Israel with efforts to improve conditions in Gaza, the U.S. might be seen as complicit in the ongoing suffering of the Palestinian population.

The Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which protects federal officials from legal liabilities, adds another layer of concern. This ruling could reduce accountability for U.S. actions in Gaza, allowing policymakers to support more aggressive strategies that neglect humanitarian concerns without fear of legal consequences. This could lead to more extreme actions that further destabilize the region and damage the U.S.’s global standing.

In summary, Project 2025’s approach to Gaza focuses heavily on security while neglecting humanitarian needs. This could lead to increased suffering, damage U.S. credibility, and destabilize the region. A more balanced approach that addresses both Israeli security and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is essential for long-term peace and stability.
