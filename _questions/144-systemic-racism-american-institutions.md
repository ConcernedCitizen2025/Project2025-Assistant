# Addressing Systemic Racism in Project 2025: A Failure to Promote Racial Equity

## *How does Project 2025 propose to address systemic racism in American institutions, including law enforcement, education, healthcare, and housing? What specific policies or reforms, if any, does it outline to promote racial equity and combat discriminatory practices?*

**Introduction**

Project 2025 presents a broad conservative agenda for American institutions, yet fails to adequately address the deep-rooted issue of systemic racism. By focusing on deregulation and market-based solutions in key areas like law enforcement, education, healthcare, and housing, the plan neglects to provide meaningful reforms aimed at promoting racial equity. This analysis explores the dangers posed by Project 2025’s approach to systemic racism, assessing how its policies could perpetuate discrimination, inequality, and injustice across the United States.

#### **Law Enforcement**

Project 2025 discusses law enforcement primarily through the lens of supporting police and ensuring law and order (Project 2025, 2024, Department of Justice). The document emphasizes the need to back law enforcement officers and enhance their ability to maintain public safety. It suggests reforms that include increasing funding for police departments, providing better training, and strengthening the legal protections for officers. However, the plan does not directly address the issue of systemic racism within law enforcement or propose specific reforms to tackle racial profiling, excessive use of force, or disparities in policing practices.

**Potential Concerns:**  
The lack of direct focus on addressing systemic racism within law enforcement is a significant concern. By primarily emphasizing support for police without acknowledging the issues of racial bias and discrimination, Project 2025 may inadvertently reinforce the status quo, where communities of color continue to face disproportionate policing and violence. The absence of targeted reforms to address these issues suggests that the plan may not adequately promote racial equity within the criminal justice system.

#### **Education**

In the realm of education, Project 2025 advocates for expanding school choice and reducing federal involvement in education (Project 2025, 2024, Department of Education). The plan supports the use of vouchers and charter schools, arguing that these options empower parents to choose the best educational environments for their children. However, it does not address the systemic inequities that exist within the education system, such as disparities in funding, resources, and outcomes between schools in predominantly white communities and those in communities of color.

**Potential Concerns:**  
While school choice is framed as a way to improve educational opportunities, it does not address the root causes of educational inequality. Without policies aimed at leveling the playing field, such as equitable funding for public schools or targeted support for under-resourced schools, school choice may exacerbate existing disparities. The focus on reducing federal oversight could further deepen these inequalities, as states and localities with histories of discriminatory practices may have greater leeway to perpetuate unequal treatment.

#### **Healthcare**

Project 2025 addresses healthcare primarily through the lens of reducing government involvement and promoting free-market solutions (Project 2025, 2024, Department of Health and Human Services). The plan advocates for deregulating the healthcare industry, reducing federal mandates, and expanding health savings accounts. However, it does not propose specific measures to address racial disparities in healthcare access, outcomes, or treatment.

**Potential Concerns:**  
The lack of targeted policies to address systemic racism in healthcare is concerning, as racial and ethnic minorities often experience poorer health outcomes due to factors like discrimination, lack of access to quality care, and socioeconomic disparities. By focusing on deregulation and market-based solutions, Project 2025 may overlook the structural barriers that contribute to these disparities, potentially widening the gap in healthcare access and outcomes between white Americans and communities of color.

#### **Housing**

In terms of housing, Project 2025 emphasizes reducing federal regulations and promoting private sector solutions to increase housing affordability and availability (Project 2025, 2024, Department of Housing and Urban Development). The plan suggests cutting back on federal housing programs and allowing the market to drive development. However, it does not address the systemic racism that has historically shaped housing policies, such as redlining, discriminatory lending practices, and zoning laws that have marginalized communities of color.

**Potential Concerns:**  
By focusing on deregulation and market-driven solutions, Project 2025 may fail to address the underlying issues of racial segregation and discrimination in housing. Without targeted interventions to rectify past injustices and promote fair housing, these policies could perpetuate the disparities that have long plagued communities of color, including unequal access to housing and homeownership opportunities.

#### **Conclusion**

Project 2025 approaches systemic racism through a largely indirect lens, focusing on broader conservative goals such as deregulation, market-based solutions, and support for law enforcement. However, the plan does not explicitly address the deep-seated racial disparities that exist in American institutions like law enforcement, education, healthcare, and housing. The lack of targeted reforms to combat discriminatory practices and promote racial equity raises significant concerns about the effectiveness of Project 2025 in addressing systemic racism. Without acknowledging and directly tackling these issues, the plan risks reinforcing existing inequalities and undermining efforts to achieve racial justice in the United States.

## <span id="nutshell">"Addressing Systemic Racism in Project 2025" In a Nutshell</span>

Project 2025's approach to systemic racism in American institutions like law enforcement, education, healthcare, and housing is largely indirect. The plan focuses on broader conservative goals such as deregulation, market-based solutions, and strong support for law enforcement. However, it fails to explicitly address the deep-seated racial disparities that exist in these areas.

**Law Enforcement:** Project 2025 emphasizes supporting police and strengthening law enforcement, but it does not address issues like racial profiling, excessive use of force, or the disparities in how communities of color are policed. Without targeted reforms, there is a risk that the plan could reinforce existing biases in the criminal justice system rather than promote racial equity.

**Education:** The plan advocates for school choice and reducing federal involvement, with a focus on vouchers and charter schools. However, it overlooks the systemic inequities in education, such as funding and resource disparities between schools in predominantly white communities and those in communities of color. By not addressing these issues, Project 2025 risks exacerbating educational inequalities.

**Healthcare:** In healthcare, Project 2025 promotes deregulation and free-market solutions but does not propose specific measures to address racial disparities in healthcare access, outcomes, or treatment. This lack of focus on the unique challenges faced by racial and ethnic minorities could lead to a widening gap in healthcare equity.

**Housing:** The plan emphasizes reducing federal regulations in housing and promoting private sector solutions but fails to address the historical and systemic racism that has shaped housing policies. Without interventions to rectify past injustices, these policies could perpetuate housing inequalities and segregation.

In summary, Project 2025 does not directly confront systemic racism or propose specific policies to combat discriminatory practices. The lack of targeted reforms raises significant concerns about the plan's effectiveness in promoting racial equity. Without acknowledging and addressing these deep-seated issues, the plan risks reinforcing existing inequalities and undermining efforts to achieve racial justice in the United States.
